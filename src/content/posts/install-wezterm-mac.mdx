## Install and configure Wezterm on Mac

In this section we are going to see all the things we need to do to have Wezterm configured on Mac with everything needed.

### Install homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software on Apple's operating system. It's an essential tool for developers and power users, making it easy to install and manage various command-line tools and applications.

To install Homebrew, open your terminal and run the following command:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This command does the following:
1. It uses `curl` to download the Homebrew installation script from GitHub.
2. The `-fsSL` flags ensure a quiet, fail-fast download with automatic redirection.
3. The downloaded script is then piped directly to bash for execution.

After running this command, follow any on-screen prompts to complete the installation. You may need to enter your system password to grant the necessary permissions.

Once Homebrew is installed, you can verify the installation by running:

```sh
brew --version
```

This should display the version of Homebrew installed on your system.

With Homebrew set up, you're now ready to easily install Wezterm and other necessary components for your terminal setup.

### Install Wezterm

Now that we have Homebrew installed, we can easily install Wezterm. Run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
brew install --cask wezterm
```

This command uses Homebrew's `cask` functionality, which is designed for installing macOS applications and large binaries. The `--cask` flag tells Homebrew to use the Cask version of the formula.

After the installation is complete, you can launch Wezterm from your Applications folder or by using Spotlight (Cmd + Space, then type "Wezterm").

### Install Git

Git is a distributed version control system that's essential for many development workflows. While macOS comes with Git pre-installed, it's often an older version. To ensure you have the latest version, let's install Git using Homebrew:

```sh
brew install git
```

This command will install the latest version of Git available through Homebrew.

After installation, you can verify the Git version by running:

```sh
git --version
```

This should display the version of Git you just installed, which should be more recent than the one that came with your Mac.

Installing Git through Homebrew also makes it easier to keep it updated in the future. You can update all Homebrew packages, including Git, with the command:

```sh
brew upgrade
```

With Wezterm and Git installed, you're now ready to move on to the next steps in customizing your terminal environment.

### Install Meslo Nerd Font

Nerd Fonts are a collection of fonts that have been patched with a high number of glyphs (icons). They're particularly useful for developers as they include many programming-related icons that can enhance your terminal and text editor experience.

To install the Meslo Nerd Font using Homebrew, run the following command:

```sh
brew install font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

This command does the following:
1. It uses Homebrew to install the Meslo LG Nerd Font.
2. The font will be downloaded and installed in your system's font directory.

After running this command, the font should be available for use in Wezterm and other applications on your Mac.

To verify that the font was installed correctly, you can check your Font Book application or use it in an application that allows font selection.

It's worth noting that you may need to restart Wezterm or any other applications where you want to use this font after installation.

The Meslo Nerd Font is an excellent choice for terminal use as it's clear, easily readable, and includes a wide range of glyphs that can be useful in command-line interfaces and programming environments.

In the next section, we'll configure Wezterm to use this newly installed font.

### Setup Wezterm Config File

Wezterm uses a Lua configuration file to customize its behavior and appearance. Let's create and configure this file.

#### Create the Config File

First, we need to create the configuration file in the correct location. Run these commands in your terminal:

```sh
touch ~/.wezterm.lua
vim ~/.wezterm.lua
```

These commands do the following:
1. `touch` creates an empty file named `.wezterm.lua` in your home directory.
2. `vim` opens this file in the Vim text editor. If you're not comfortable with Vim, you can use any text editor you prefer.

#### Configure Wezterm

Now that we've created the file, let's add some configuration. Copy and paste the following Lua code into your `.wezterm.lua` file:

```lua
-- Pull in the wezterm API
local wezterm = require("wezterm")

-- This will hold the configuration.
local config = wezterm.config_builder()

-- This is where you actually apply your config choices

config.font = wezterm.font("MesloLGS Nerd Font Mono")
config.font_size = 19

config.window_decorations = "RESIZE"
config.window_background_opacity = 0.8
config.macos_window_background_blur = 10

-- my coolnight colorscheme:
config.colors = {
    foreground = "#CBE0F0",
    background = "#011423",
    cursor_bg = "#47FF9C",
    cursor_border = "#47FF9C",
    cursor_fg = "#011423",
    selection_bg = "#033259",
    selection_fg = "#CBE0F0",
    ansi = { "#214969", "#E52E2E", "#44FFB1", "#FFE073", "#0FC5ED", "#a277ff", "#24EAF7", "#24EAF7" },
    brights = { "#214969", "#E52E2E", "#44FFB1", "#FFE073", "#A277FF", "#a277ff", "#24EAF7", "#24EAF7" },
}

-- and finally, return the configuration to wezterm
return config
```

Let's break down what this configuration does:

1. It sets the font to the Meslo Nerd Font we just installed.
2. Sets the font size to 19.
3. Configures the window to be resizable.
4. Sets the background opacity to 80% and adds a blur effect (MacOS only).
5. Defines a custom color scheme called "coolnight".

`config.colors` description:

1. `foreground = "#CBE0F0"`: This sets the default text color to a light blue-gray.

2. `background = "#011423"`: This sets the background color to a very dark blue, almost black.

3. `cursor_bg = "#47FF9C"`: This sets the background color of the cursor to a bright green.

4. `cursor_border = "#47FF9C"`: This sets the border color of the cursor to the same bright green.

5. `cursor_fg = "#011423"`: This sets the foreground color of the cursor (for block cursors) to the same dark blue as the background.

6. `selection_bg = "#033259"`: This sets the background color for selected text to a dark blue.

7. `selection_fg = "#CBE0F0"`: This sets the foreground color for selected text to the same light blue-gray as the default text.

8. `ansi = {...}`: This array defines the colors for the first 8 ANSI color codes (0-7). These are used for basic color formatting in the terminal.

9. `brights = {...}`: This array defines the colors for the bright versions of the ANSI color codes (8-15). These are often used for bold or highlighted text.

In both `ansi` and `brights` arrays, the colors represent:
- Black
- Red
- Green
- Yellow
- Blue
- Magenta
- Cyan
- White

This color scheme appears to be a custom "coolnight" theme, with a dark blue background and various bright, contrasting colors for text and highlights. It's designed to be easy on the eyes while providing good contrast for readability.

After saving this file and restarting Wezterm, you should see the changes take effect. You can further customize this configuration to your liking by adjusting colors, key bindings, and other settings as needed.

Remember, Wezterm's configuration is dynamic and in Lua, so you can add conditional logic, functions, and even pull in external data if you want to create a more complex setup.

### Install powerlevel10k theme

Powerlevel10k is a highly customizable theme for Zsh that emphasizes speed, flexibility, and out-of-the-box experience. It's designed to make your command line informative and visually appealing without sacrificing performance.
