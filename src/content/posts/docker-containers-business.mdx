In today's digital landscape, businesses of all sizes are increasingly turning to self-hosted solutions to maintain control over their data, reduce costs, and customize their software environment. Docker containers have revolutionized the way applications are deployed and managed, offering a lightweight, portable, and efficient method for running software. This article explores the world of Docker containers for businesses, discussing where they can be hosted and highlighting 20+ essential containers that can significantly enhance your business operations.

## Where Docker Containers For Business Can be Hosted

When it comes to hosting self hosted apps on docker containers for your business, you have several options, each with its own advantages. Let's explore two popular choices: VPS servers and home servers.

When selecting a VPS provider, consider factors such as pricing, performance, data center locations, and support options. Both Hetzner and DigitalOcean offer user-friendly interfaces and extensive documentation to help you get started with Docker containers.

### Home Server

For businesses with specific security requirements or those looking to maximize control over their infrastructure, a home server can be an excellent option for hosting Docker containers. There are two main approaches to setting up a home server:

#### Mini PC

Mini PCs have gained popularity as home servers due to their compact size, energy efficiency, and sufficient power for running Docker containers. Some advantages of using a mini PC as a home server include:

- **Low power consumption**: Ideal for 24/7 operation without significant energy costs
- **Quiet operation**: Many models are fanless or have low-noise cooling systems
- **Customizable**: Choose from a variety of models to fit your specific needs
- **Cost-effective**: Often more affordable than traditional server hardware
