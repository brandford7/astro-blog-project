Docker Compose allows you to set up complex application stacks, including database services. While PostgreSQL's official Docker image supports creating a single database by default, you can configure it to create multiple databases within one container.

There are a few common reasons why you might want to set up multiple databases in the same Docker Compose service:

1. **Development and testing environments:** When developing or testing an application that uses multiple databases, it's convenient to have all the databases running in a single container for simplicity.

2. **Resource efficiency:** Using a single container for multiple databases can be more resource-efficient than running separate containers for each database, especially in development environments.

3. **Legacy application support:** Some legacy applications may expect multiple databases to be available on the same server. Replicating this setup in Docker can make migration easier.

4. **Microservices architecture:** In a microservices architecture, you might have multiple small databases that are closely related and benefit from being grouped together.

5. **Data isolation:** You may want to isolate different types of data (e.g. user data, product data, analytics) into separate databases for security or organizational reasons, while still keeping them in the same service.

6. **Multi-tenant applications:** For applications serving multiple tenants, you might want a separate database for each tenant, but still keep them managed within a single service.

7. **Testing database migrations:** When testing database migrations or upgrades, it can be useful to have multiple versions or states of a database available simultaneously.

8. **Reducing complexity:** For smaller projects or prototypes, having all databases in one container can reduce the overall complexity of the Docker setup.

However, it's important to note that while this approach can be useful for development and testing, for production environments it's generally recommended to use separate containers for different databases to ensure better isolation, scalability, and easier management. The specific needs of your project and environment should guide the decision on whether to use multiple databases in a single service or separate them into different containers.

## Step 1: Create the Initialization Script

First, create a bash script that will initialize multiple databases. Save this script as `init-multiple-databases.sh`:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

set -e
set -u

function create_user_and_database() {
  local database=$1
  echo "  Creating user and database '$database'"
  psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname "postgres" <<-EOSQL
        CREATE USER $database;
        CREATE DATABASE $database;
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE $database TO $database;
EOSQL
}

if [ -n "${POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES:-}" ]; then
  echo "Multiple database creation requested: $POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES"
  for db in $(echo $POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES | tr ',' ' '); do
    create_user_and_database $db
  done
  echo "Multiple databases created"
fi
```

The script is taking a list of databases and connects to the Postgress and creates the databases and grants all privilages.

## Step 2: Create the Docker Compose File

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    container_name: postgres_multi_db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER:-postgres}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-changeme}
      POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES: db1,db2,db3
    volumes:
      - ./init-multiple-databases.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-multiple-databases.sh
      - ./postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    restart: unless-stopped
```

The postgres 16 will be uses to create the container and the user and password will be fetched from `.env` file. The `POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES` has the list with databases to be created. All the DBs will use the same user and pass. The script from previous points `init-multiple-databases.sh` is is loaded from the docker compose file.

## Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)

Create a .env file in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml to store sensitive information:

```sh
POSTGRES_USER=myuser
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mypassword
```

## Step 4: Run the Docker Compose Stack

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

```

## Step 5: Verify the Databases

To confirm that the databases were created successfully, you can connect to the PostgreSQL container and list the databases:

```sh
docker exec -it postgres_multi_db psql -U myuser -c "\l"
```

```sh
root@docker-cloud:/opt/stacks/multi-postgress# docker exec -it postgres_multi_db psql -U bitdoze -c "\l"
                                                     List of databases

## Different users and Passwords for Databases

To handle different user permissions for each database in Docker Compose when setting up multiple PostgreSQL databases, you can modify the initialization script and Docker Compose configuration. Here's how to achieve this:

1. Update the initialization script (init-multiple-databases.sh) to accept custom users and permissions:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

set -e
set -u

function create_user_and_database() {
    local database=$1
    local user=$2
    local password=$3
    echo "Creating user '$user' and database '$database'"
    psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 --username "$POSTGRES_USER" --dbname "postgres" <<-EOSQL
        CREATE USER $user WITH PASSWORD '$password';
        CREATE DATABASE $database;
        GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE $database TO $user;
EOSQL
}

if [ -n "${POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES:-}" ]; then
    echo "Multiple database creation requested: $POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES"
    for db_config in $(echo $POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES | tr ',' ' '); do
        IFS=':' read -r db user password <<< "$db_config"
        create_user_and_database $db $user $password
    done
    echo "Multiple databases created"
fi
```

2. Modify your `docker-compose.yml` file to pass the database configurations:

```yml
version: "3.8"
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    container_name: postgres_multi_db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER:-postgres}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-changeme}
      POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES: db1:user1:pass1,db2:user2:pass2,db3:user3:pass3
    volumes:
      - ./init-multiple-databases.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/init-multiple-databases.sh
      - ./postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Here `POSTGRES_MULTIPLE_DATABASES: db1:user1:pass1,db2:user2:pass2,db3:user3:pass3` will contain the DB,USER and PASS, you can add this into you `.env` if you want to make it secure.

This is how easy it is to have multiple databases created in docker compose for same postgres service.
