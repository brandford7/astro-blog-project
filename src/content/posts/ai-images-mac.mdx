### 7. How Much It Takes

I have the M4 Pro base model with 24GB of RAM. When I am generating one image with Flux Dev and 25 steps at 704x704 it takes about 6 minutes to have an image generated. When I use the default model 30 seconds.

The Flux generation on DiffusionBee is using 7 GB of RAM with 50% off GPU. THe standard one half of the RAM and GPU from Flux.
