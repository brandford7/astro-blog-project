I am a WordPress user for years and lately, I have wanted to try something new and see how different it is. I have another website [WP Doze](https://www.wpdoze.com/) where I write about WordPress things but wanted to try something different.
After searching online I found [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) a static website generator that can help you have a blog or website fast, did a lot of [Gatsby courses](https://www.bitdoze.com/gatsby-js-online-courses/) to find out what is about and eventually came across [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Astro is not around for a long time but it is here to stay, I like it as it is fast and it is easy to set it up. Same as with Gatsby in the beginning I have searched online for a lot of [Astro.js Trainings](https://www.bitdoze.com/best-astrojs-online-courses/) to see what is about and modify some aspects myself if I need it.

In this article, we will see how you can deploy your Astro website on Cloudflare pages and have a free blog or website in the function of your needs.

I will use the [GitHub Bit Doze blog theme](https://github.com/bitdoze/bitdoze.com) for the deployment and guide you through what you need to change to host your blog. The Theme is built on [AstroWind theme](https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind) and you can install either as it's the same and you should change the same thing just mine has only the blog things active.

## How To Deploy An Astro.Js Blog On Cloudflare

You can check this tutorial showing how you can deploy Astro on your VPS with a Heroko or Netlify alternative Coolify: [Coolify Install A Free Heroku and Netlify Self-Hosted Alternative](https://www.bitdoze.com/coolify-install-heroku-alternative/) or [How to Deploy Astro on Your VPS with EasyPanel](https://www.bitdoze.com/deploy-astro-easypanel/)

### 1. Setup Node.js and Github

Cloudflare Pages are using GitHub to fetch the details and node.js is needed so you can view the project before deploying it on Cloudflare to be sure is working to prepare your laptop just follow the below 2 tutorials to get you going:

- [How to Install Node.js using NVM on MacOS and Ubuntu](https://www.bitdoze.com/install-nodejs-using-nvm-macos-ubuntu/)
- [Link GitHub with A SSH Key to MacOS or Linux](https://www.bitdoze.com/link-github-with-ssh-maco-linux/)

### 2. Fetch the [AstroWind theme](https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind) or [Bit Doze simpified theme](https://github.com/bitdoze/bitdoze.com)

To do this you need to open the GitHub project and hit **Use this template** button. Be sure you are logged in to have this enabled.

### 3. Modify the theme files

#### 3.1 Modify URL with Title and Description

[AstroWind theme](https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind) or [Bit Doze simplified theme](https://github.com/bitdoze/bitdoze.com) has a config file that you need to modify it and change the details for your website. The location is under _src/config.mjs_

Here replace the:

- name - with your website name
- origin - with the URL for your website
- basePathname - add something in case this is using a subdirectory
- title - will be used in the main URL
- description - website description
- googleAnalyticsId - in case you want analytics added to the website
- googleSiteVerificationId- for Google Web Central ( I recommend the use of DNS verification instead)

Other changes are for the url, category, tags. You can let them like this if you want.
Below is the file used for bitdoze.com:

```js
export const SITE = {
  name: "Bit Doze",

  origin: "https://www.bitdoze.com",
  basePathname: "/",

  title: "Bit Doze Website",
  description:
    "An Website about Linux, blogging, CMS and other internet news..",

  googleAnalyticsId: false, // or "G-XXXXXXXXXX",
  googleSiteVerificationId: "jyQEUqY6oYZKY6ZhkHatU7g4vVBBSb7z3Zw5bA",
};

export const BLOG = {
  disabled: false,
  postsPerPage: 9,

  blog: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: "blog", // blog main path, you can change this to "articles" (/articles)
  },

  post: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: "", // empty for /some-post, value for /pathname/some-post
  },

  category: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: "", // set empty to change from /category/some-category to /some-category
  },

  tag: {
    disabled: false,
    pathname: "tag", // set empty to change from /tag/some-tag to /some-tag
  },
};
```

#### 3.2 Modify Header Links

The themes is using by default my blog categories so you need to add the categories you want and pages in the menu. To alter them you just need to open the file under _src/components/widgets/Header.astro_

In here just add or delete the _li_ by modifying the _href_ with the path you have, eg:

```html
<li>
  <a
    class="font-medium hover:text-gray-900 dark:hover:text-white px-4 py-3 flex items-center transition duration-150 ease-in-out"
    href="/cms/"
    >CMS</a
  >
</li>
```

To add a new thing just add a new li and change the url and name.

#### 3.3 Modify the footer links

In the footer I have some links to my twitter and GitHub profile, you should change them or delete them as per your needs. This can be done from _src/components/widgets/Footer.astro_

```html
<li>
  <a
    class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-700 rounded-lg text-sm p-2.5 inline-flex items-center"
    aria-label="Twitter"
    href="https://twitter.com/bitdozecom"
  >
    <Icon name="tabler:brand-twitter" class="w-5 h-5" />
  </a>
</li>
```

#### 3.4 Modify the Logo

Logo is a text one, created from a gradient colour of primary and secondary, to modify it you just need to go under _src/components/atoms/Logo.astro_ and modify the text:

```html
<span
  class="bg-clip-text font-bold text-4xl text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-primary-500 to-secondary-500 sm:whitespace-nowrap"
>
  Bit Doze</span
>
```

#### 3.5 Modify the Hero with your description and social links

In the front page I have Hero with the welcome and social links, to modify the text icons and links you should alter the _src/components/widgets/Hero.astro_ In here you have the h1 and div with text and ul with the social icons. This is using Astra Icon so you can add anything you want.

```html
<h1
  class="text-5xl md:text-[3.50rem] font-bold leading-tighter tracking-tighter mb-4 font-heading"
>
  Welcome to
  <span
    class="bg-clip-text text-transparent bg-gradient-to-r from-primary-500 to-secondary-500 sm:whitespace-nowrap"
    >Bit Doze</span
  >
</h1>
<div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
  <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8 dark:text-slate-400">
    Join the community to find out more about, VPS, blogging, CMS.
  </p>
</div>

<ul
  class="flex justify-center items-center mb-4 md:order-1 -ml-2 md:ml-4 md:mb-0"
>
  <li>
    <a
      class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 hover:bg-gray-100 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-4 focus:ring-gray-200 dark:focus:ring-gray-700 rounded-lg text-sm p-2.5 inline-flex items-center"
      aria-label="Twitter"
      href="https://twitter.com/bitdoze"
    >
      <Icon name="tabler:brand-twitter" class="w-20 h-20" />
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

#### 3.5 Modify the main colours

The theme is coming with the main colour that is used around the components to change the color you can take a look on [tailwind colors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors) and modify the _tailwind.config.cjs_ under colors primary and secondary

```js
colors: {
				primary: colors.blue,
				secondary: colors.indigo,
			},
```

#### 3.6 Cleanup Assets folder and data folder

Currently, the theme has my mdx posts and images, you may want to clean up the _src/assets/images/_ and _data/blog/_ to add your md files with articles and things.

#### 3.7 Add You Articles to the first page Blog Roll

After you added your own articles with picture to modify the first page articles you need to go under _src/components/blog/HighlightedPosts.astro_ and add your articles. Just replace the below with your own:

```js
const ids = [
  "deploy-astrojs-cloudflare",
  "best-astrojs-online-courses",
  "link-github-with-ssh-maco-linux",
  "install-nodejs-using-nvm-macos-ubuntu",
  "gatsby-js-online-courses",
  "embed-youtube-videos-to-gatsby",
];
```

### 4. Preview the changes and update the GitLab project with the latest changes

After we confirm the project and have added our article we can see if everything is OK and we can push the project to GitLab to host it in Cloudflare Pages.

To preview the changes just run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the localhost:3000 or the link specified to see if you have everything in order. In case everything looks good you should proceed and push the project to GitLab:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "configured my website"
git push
```

### 5. Host the project in CloudFlare

Cloudflare can be used to host Astro, they have also this documentation [Deploy Astro Sites](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/astro/)

With the free account, you have 500 monthly builds and you benefit from their CDN so the website is very fast. These 500 builds are more than enough to host a blog or have a few. Every time you push an article or a change to GitHub Cloudflare will pick the latest change and will count it as a build.

You need to go under Pages and add create a project. There you connect it to your git repo and begin the setup.

You choose:

- Production branch: main
- Build command: npm run build
- Build directory: dist
- Environment Variables NODE_VERSION: 16

<Picture

Then you hit save and deploy and that is all. When you want to add an article you just need to push the change and Cloudflare will do the rest.
