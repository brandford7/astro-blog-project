Markdown is a **lightweight markup language** that makes text formatting simple and readable. Whether you're writing documentation, blogging, or creating content for static websites, Markdown helps you format text without complex HTML or rich-text editors.

In this guide, weâ€™ll cover:

**What a Markdown file is**  
**How to bold text**  
**Indentation techniques**  
**How to use strikethrough**  
**Additional Markdown syntax**

Let's begin by understanding what a markdown file is;

## What is a Markdown File?

A **Markdown file** is a plain text file with formatting syntax that can be converted into HTML, PDF, or other formats. Itâ€™s widely used in **documentation, blogging, note-taking, and coding environments** like GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks.

### Key Characteristics

- **File Extensions:** `.mdx`, `.md`, or `.markdown`
- **Common Use Cases:** README files, technical documentation, blogs
- **Supported Platforms:** GitHub, VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, and more
- **Easy Conversion:** Markdown files can be converted into **HTML, PDF, Word**  

### Example Markdown File  

```md
# Welcome to Markdown!

Markdown allows for **bold text**, _italic text_, and ~~strikethrough~~.

- This is a list item  
- [Click here](https://example.com) for a link  

> This is a blockquote.  
```

## How to Bold in Markdown  

To **bold** text in Markdown, use either double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`):

```md
**This is bold text**
__This is also bold text__
```

**Rendered output:**  
**This is bold text**  
**This is also bold text**  

### Combining Bold and Italics  

```md
**_This is bold and italic_**
__*This is also bold and italic*__
```

**Rendered output:**  
**_This is bold and italic_**  
_**This is also bold and italic**__

### When to Use Bold Text?  

- To highlight **important** information  
- To emphasize key points in documentation  
- To make section titles stand out

## How to Indent in Markdown  

Markdown does **not** have a direct way to indent paragraphs, but you can use:  

1. **Code blocks**  
2. **Blockquotes**  
3. **List indentation**  

### Indenting Code Blocks  

To **indent code**, use triple backticks (```) or indent lines with **four spaces**:

````md
```
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
````

**Rendered output:**

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Blockquote Indentation  

To **indent text**, use `>`:

```md
> This is an indented blockquote.
>
> > This is a nested blockquote.
```

**Rendered output:**  

> This is an indented blockquote.  
>
> > This is a nested blockquote.  

### Indenting Lists  

Use spaces or tabs to create **nested lists**:

```md
- First level
  - Second level
    - Third level
```

**Rendered output:**  

- First level  
  - Second level  
    - Third level  

For **ordered lists**:

```md
1. Main item  
   1.1 Sub-item  
   - Bullet inside a numbered list  
```

**Rendered output:**  

1. Main item  
   1.1 Sub-item  
   - Bullet inside a numbered list

## Markdown Strikethrough  

Strikethrough is done with double tildes (`~~`):

```md
~~This text is strikethrough~~
```

**Rendered output:**  
~~This text is strikethrough~~

### Mixing Strikethrough with Other Formatting  

```md
~~**Bold strikethrough**~~  
~~_Italic strikethrough_~~
```

**Rendered output:**  
~~**Bold strikethrough**~~  
~~_Italic strikethrough_~~

## Additional Markdown Syntax  

### Headings  

Use `#` to define headings:

```md
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```

**Rendered output:**  

## H2  

### H3  

#### H4  

##### H5  

###### H6  

### Horizontal Lines  

Use `---` or `___` for dividers:

```md
---
```

**Rendered output:**  

---

### Links  

```md
[Visit my website](https://example.com)
```

ðŸ‘‰ **Rendered output:**  
[Visit my website](https://example.com)

### Images  

```md
