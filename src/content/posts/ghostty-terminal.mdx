- Sharing terminal sessions with other users
- Preserving your terminal setup across system reboots

To learn more about tmux and its basic usage, check out this guide: [Tmux Basics](https://www.bitdoze.com/tmux-basics/)

To install tmux using Homebrew, run:

```sh
brew install tmux
```

After installation, you can start a new tmux session by simply typing `tmux` in your terminal.

### What is zoxide and how can it help

Zoxide is a smarter cd command that helps you navigate your filesystem more efficiently. It remembers which directories you use most frequently, so you can "jump" to them in just a few keystrokes.

Key features of zoxide include:

- Faster navigation to frequently-used directories
- Fuzzy matching for directory names
- Integration with common shells and file managers

For a detailed guide on using zoxide, refer to this article: [Zoxide Guide](https://www.bitdoze.com/zoxide/)

To install zoxide using Homebrew, run:

```sh
brew install zoxide
```

Then, add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` file to initialize zoxide:

```sh
eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"
```

After restarting your shell or running `source ~/.zshrc`, you can start using zoxide. For example, use `z` instead of `cd` to navigate to directories.

By integrating tmux and zoxide with Ghostty, you're creating a powerful, efficient terminal environment. Tmux allows you to manage complex workflows with multiple panes and windows, while zoxide speeds up your navigation between projects and directories. Together with Ghostty's GPU acceleration and customizability, you'll have a terminal setup that significantly boosts your productivity.

## Known Ghostty Erros


###  'xterm-ghostty': unknown terminal type

When I try to run `top` on a bash Linux 6 environment I get the error: `'xterm-ghostty': unknown terminal type.` To fix that I just do in the session:

```sh
export TERM=xterm-256color
```

You can add that in your `.bashrc` if you have only a couple of servers I have thousands :)

```sh
echo "export TERM=xterm-256color" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
