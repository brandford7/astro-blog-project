### Setup A VPS

To get started with Dokploy, you need a Virtual Private Server (VPS).
In the video, we go into detail about how you can do that on Hetzner. You can check this [Hetzner Review](https://www.wpdoze.com/hetzner-cloud-review/) for more details if you are not aware of Hetzner and what it can do.

<Button link="https://go.bitdoze.com/hetzner" text="Hetzner €⁠20 Free" />

```sh
ssh username@your_vps_ip
```

### Add SWAP

Adding swap space can help improve the performance of your VPS by providing additional virtual memory. Follow these steps to add a 2GB swap file:

```sh
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

### Install Dokploy

Once your VPS is set up and swap space is added, you can install Dokploy using the following command:

```sh
curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | sh
```

This command will download and run the Dokploy installation script, setting up Dokploy and its dependencies on your server.

### Point Your Domain or Subdomain to Dokploy

To access your Dokploy instance via a custom domain or subdomain, you need to configure your DNS settings:

1. **Log in to your DNS provider**: Access the DNS management console of your domain registrar.
2. **Create an A Record**: Point your domain or subdomain to the IP address of your VPS.

For example, to point `app.yourdomain.com` to your VPS:

```
Type: A
Name: app
Value: your_vps_ip
TTL: 3600
```

## Start Deploying Apps
