##  Install CrowdSec
---

Installing CrowdSec on your VPS is a straightforward process that involves adding a repository, installing the package, and configuring it to monitor logs. Below is a detailed step-by-step guide to help you get started.

### Step 1: Add the CrowdSec Repository
CrowdSec can be installed using its package repository for most Linux distributions. Add the repository by running the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://install.crowdsec.net | sudo sh
```

#### Expected Output:
Your system should respond with the following information, confirming the repository was successfully added:
```
Detected operating system as ubuntu/22.
Detected apt version as 2.4.13
Checking for gpg...
Detected gpg...
...
Installing /etc/apt/sources.list.d/crowdsec_crowdsec.list...
```

This command imports the necessary GPG keys and sets up the CrowdSec repository.


### Step 2: Install the CrowdSec Package

Once the repository is added, update your package index and install the CrowdSec package:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install crowdsec
```

#### Important Notes:
- **Port Usage Warning:** CrowdSec’s local API uses **port 8080** by default. Before proceeding, ensure the port is not already in use by checking with:
  ```bash
  netstat -tulpn
  ```
  If port 8080 is busy, you can modify the configuration later (explained below).

#### Sample Installation Output:
Here’s an example of what you might see during installation:
```
Need to get 60.9 MB of archives.
After this operation, 249 MB of additional disk space will be used.
...
Setting up crowdsec (1.6.4) ...
Machine successfully added to the local API.
API credentials written to '/etc/crowdsec/local_api_credentials.yaml'.
...
Not attempting to start crowdsec, port 8080 is already used or lapi was disabled.
```


### Step 3: Modify API Port (If Necessary)

If you encounter the error stating that port 8080 is in use, you’ll need to edit CrowdSec’s configuration files to change the default API port. Here’s a quick guide:

1. Open the configuration files for editing:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/crowdsec/config.yaml
   sudo nano /etc/crowdsec/local_api_credentials.yaml
   ```
2. Change the `listen_uri` under `api` to a different port, such as 8081:
   ```yaml
   listen_uri: 127.0.0.1:8081
   ```
3. Save the files and restart CrowdSec:
   ```bash
   sudo service crowdsec start
   sudo service crowdsec status
   ```

Once updated, the service should run successfully, and you can verify its status with:

```bash
sudo service crowdsec status
```

#### Example Output:
```
● crowdsec.service - Crowdsec agent
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/crowdsec.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Thu 2025-02-06 06:52:02 UTC; 5s ago
```


### Step 4: List Installed Collections

After installation, CrowdSec automatically installs collections to monitor key services like SSH. To check the collections in use, run:

```bash
sudo cscli collections list
```

#### Example Output:
```
COLLECTIONS
 Name                               📦 Status    Version  Local Path
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 crowdsecurity/linux                ✔️  enabled  0.2      ...
 crowdsecurity/sshd                 ✔️  enabled  0.5      ...
```

The `crowdsecurity/sshd` collection indicates SSH monitoring is active.


With CrowdSec installed and running, your VPS is now set up to detect and analyze potential threats targeting your SSH and other services.


##  Installing the First Remediation Component (Firewall Bouncer)
---

CrowdSec relies on remediation components called “bouncers” to block malicious actors based on detected attack patterns. The **firewall bouncer** is one of the most critical components for enhancing your VPS’s security since it works with your server’s firewall to block IPs flagged by CrowdSec.

Here’s how to install and verify the firewall bouncer:



### Step 1: Install the Firewall Bouncer

To install the `iptables` firewall bouncer with CrowdSec, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install crowdsec-firewall-bouncer-iptables
```

#### Output Example:
When the installation completes, you’ll see something like this:
```
The following NEW packages will be installed:
  crowdsec-firewall-bouncer-iptables
0 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 4 not upgraded.
...
Setting up crowdsec-firewall-bouncer (0.0.31) ...
```

The bouncer is now integrated into your system and ready to block malicious IPs.



### Step 2: Verify the Bouncer Installation

After installation, check the firewall bouncer’s status and confirm it’s operating correctly:

```bash
sudo cscli bouncers list
```

#### Example Output:
```
╭───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│ Name                            IP Address  Valid  Last API pull         Type                       Version    │
├───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ cs-firewall-bouncer-1738824978  127.0.0.1   ✔️    2025-02-06T06:57:35Z  crowdsec-firewall-bouncer  v0.0.31    │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Key details in the output:
- **Name:** The unique identifier of the bouncer.
- **Type:** Indicates this is the `crowdsec-firewall-bouncer`.
- **Status:** `Valid` confirms the bouncer is active.
- **Last API pull:** Shows when the bouncer last synced with the CrowdSec engine.


### Step 3: How the Firewall Bouncer Works

The firewall bouncer automatically updates your firewall rules with decisions made by CrowdSec. For example, if a brute-force attack is detected on your SSH port, the bouncer will add the attacker’s IP to the blocking rules in `iptables`.

You can manually verify the active firewall rules with:

```bash
sudo iptables -L
```



### Troubleshooting Installation Issues

If the firewall bouncer doesn’t appear in the `cscli bouncers list` output or isn’t working correctly:
- **Restart the bouncer service:**
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart crowdsec-firewall-bouncer
  ```
- **Check the logs for errors:**
  ```bash
  sudo tail -f /var/log/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.log
  ```



### Why Is the Firewall Bouncer Important?

The firewall bouncer ensures that CrowdSec not only detects malicious activity but also takes immediate action to mitigate threats. It’s particularly effective in:
1. Blocking brute force attempts on SSH.
2. Stopping known malicious IPs based on community-shared data.
3. Protecting other services like Nginx when integrated with appropriate configurations.

By enabling the firewall bouncer, you’re taking the most critical step in actively defending your VPS from real-time attacks.



##  See What Logs Are Monitored by CrowdSec
---

CrowdSec is designed to analyze logs from various sources on your server to detect suspicious patterns and potential attacks. Upon installation, CrowdSec includes default collections for commonly used services, such as SSH and Nginx. These collections specify which log files CrowdSec monitors and define the detection scenarios for each service.

### Viewing the Log Files Monitored

CrowdSec creates and uses a file called `acquis.yaml` to configure the log files it monitors. You can inspect this file to see the services and log locations that CrowdSec is currently set up to analyze.

Run the following command to view the log monitoring configuration:
```bash
cat /etc/crowdsec/acquis.yaml
```

#### Sample Output:
```yaml
# Generated acquisition file - wizard.sh (service: nginx) / files : /var/log/nginx/error.log
filenames:
  - /var/log/nginx/error.log
labels:
  type: nginx
---
# Generated acquisition file - wizard.sh (service: ssh) / files :
journalctl_filter:
  - _SYSTEMD_UNIT=ssh.service
labels:
  type: syslog
---
```

From this example, you can see that CrowdSec is configured to monitor:
1. **Nginx logs:** Located in `/var/log/nginx/error.log`.
2. **SSH logs:** Captured from journald using the `_SYSTEMD_UNIT=ssh.service` filter.

This means CrowdSec will automatically analyze logs from these sources to detect scenarios such as brute force attacks, suspicious behavior, or repeated access failures.


### Log Files Used by CrowdSec

CrowdSec itself generates its own set of logs to help you monitor its performance and functionality. These logs are stored in `/var/log/` and include the following files:

| **File**                          | **Purpose**                                        |
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `/var/log/crowdsec.log`           | Primary log for CrowdSec’s main engine.           |
| `/var/log/crowdsec_api.log`       | Logs related to the CrowdSec API.                 |
| `/var/log/crowdsec-firewall-bouncer.log` | Logs for the firewall bouncer performance.       |

To view these logs, use commands like:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/crowdsec.log
```



### Why Is Monitoring Logs Important?

CrowdSec’s ability to monitor logs is the foundation of its detection and response capabilities. By analyzing logs from services like SSH and Nginx, it can:
- Detect brute force attacks and other suspicious patterns.
- Share anonymized attack data with the global CrowdSec network to improve the community database.
- Generate actionable remediation decisions (e.g., banning IPs).

Keeping an eye on what logs are being monitored ensures that your server is fully protected and that no critical service is left unguarded.



##   Linking to the CrowdSec Console (Optional)
---

One of the standout features of CrowdSec is the **CrowdSec Console**, a cloud-based dashboard that provides insights into your server’s security performance. The console offers centralized management, detailed attack visualization, and aggregated metrics, making it easier to monitor security events across different systems or environments.

| **Attack Trends**  | Displays common attack types.              | "60% of attacks in past week were SSH brute force." |
| **Event Timeline** | Visualizes when attacks occurred.          | "Spike of 1,000 attacks at 2 a.m. yesterday."|
| **Global Intelligence**| Community-sourced blocklists.          | "50 IPs globally flagged for DoS attacks."|




## Monitoring Application Logs (e.g., Nginx)
---

CrowdSec can monitor your application-specific logs, such as those from Nginx, Apache, or custom services, to detect and prevent attacks on web applications. This functionality ensures your entire server stack is secured, not just SSH. By analyzing logs from applications like Nginx, CrowdSec can detect patterns like bot attacks, vulnerability probes, or exploitation attempts.

### Why Monitor Nginx Logs?

Nginx is a common web server used by many VPS setups to host websites and applications. Monitoring Nginx logs with CrowdSec adds the following benefits:
- **Detect Web Attacks:** Identify bots, vulnerability scanners, SQL injection attempts, and other malicious activities.
- **Block Suspicious IPs:** CrowdSec can instantly issue bans based on log analysis, stopping attackers before they cause harm.
- **Centralized Protection:** Combine Nginx log monitoring with SSH and other logs for all-in-one remediation.


### Step 1: Install the Nginx Collection

CrowdSec uses predefined "collections" to analyze specific log types. If the Nginx collection is not already installed, you can add it with the following command:

```bash
sudo cscli collections install crowdsecurity/nginx
```

This collection includes detection scenarios tailored for Nginx logs, such as identifying SQL injection probes, directory traversal attempts, or bad user agents.

#### Example Output:
```bash
INFO[06-02-2025 07:00:02] crowdsecurity/nginx installed successfully
```



### Step 2: Update the `acquis.yaml` File

To enable CrowdSec to monitor your Nginx logs, you need to add their file paths to the configuration file located at `/etc/crowdsec/acquis.yaml`:

1. Open the file for editing:
   ```bash
   sudo vi /etc/crowdsec/acquis.yaml
   ```

2. Add the following entries under the `filenames` section for Nginx logs:
   ```yaml
   filenames:
     - /var/log/nginx/error.log
     - /home/*/logs/nginx/*.log
   labels:
     type: nginx
   ---
   ```

   - The first path (`/var/log/nginx/error.log`) includes the default error log for Nginx.
   - The second path (`/home/*/logs/nginx/*.log`) allows for monitoring additional application-specific logs (e.g., virtual hosts).

3. Save and exit the file.



### Step 3: Restart the CrowdSec Service

After updating the configuration, restart the CrowdSec service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart crowdsec
```



### Step 4: Verify Functionality

To ensure that CrowdSec is actively monitoring Nginx logs:

1. Tail the CrowdSec logs in real time to see if it’s processing Nginx logs correctly:
   ```bash
   sudo tail -f /var/log/crowdsec.log
   ```

2. Check for alerts or decisions related to Nginx:
   ```bash
   sudo cscli alerts list
   sudo cscli decisions list
   ```

If everything is working correctly, you will see entries related to Nginx logs, such as blocked IPs or detected attack scenarios.


### Example Scenarios for Nginx Monitoring

When you enable Nginx log monitoring, CrowdSec can detect and mitigate the following attack types:
1. **SQL Injection Probes:** Attempts to exploit database vulnerabilities.
2. **Directory Traversal Attacks:** Malicious requests designed to access unauthorized files or directories.
3. **Bad User Agents:** Bots or scrapers with malicious intent.
4. **Rate Limiting Violations:** Excessive request patterns from abusive IPs.



By monitoring Nginx logs with CrowdSec, you extend protection to your web applications, ensuring that both your server infrastructure and hosted services are secure.
