As carrd.co is not coming up with an easy way to add a pricing table in the widgets it has you will need to be on the Pro Plus plan that will allow you to embed code. In the below tutorial, we are going to see everything that needs to be done to have a responsive pricing table.

### 1. Download the Pricing Table Code

The first thing to do is to download the code that you are going to use on your Carrd website. To do that just go to: [Carrd Pricing Table](https://webdoze.net/buy/carrd-co-pricing-table/) and get your pricing table. It's not free it costs $5 which is the price of a coffee.

### 2. Customize the Code

After you have your code you will be able to change colors, prices, and font and add the price elements for your business. The code that will help you do this is outlined below:

**Change Colours**

```css
:root {
  --priceb-col-gr: linear-gradient(
    135deg,
    rgba(163, 168, 240, 1) 0%,
    rgba(105, 111, 221, 1) 100%
  );
}
```

**Change Font**

You can use your won font, you can alter the bellow line under style:

```css
font-family: inherit;
```

The above code holds the colors for buttons, active card, and toggle. You can change or add your color and will be used automatically as this is a css variable.

**Change Prices**

You need to edit 2 elements for the prices, 1 is for html code:

```html
<li id="basic" class="price bottom-bar">&dollar;199.99</li>
```

The other one is for the java script where it has the toggle:

```js
const prices = {
  basic: { monthly: "$19.99", annual: "$199.99" },
  professional: { monthly: "$24.99", annual: "$249.99" },
  master: { monthly: "$39.99", annual: "$399.99" },
};
```

You can add your own prices don't forget to change the plan name in case you use custom ones for your business.

**Change Elements**

To add your own price elements you just replace the `li` items in each card with your own, you can add more to suite your needs.

```html
<li class="bottom-bar">1 TB Storage</li>
<li class="bottom-bar">5 Users Allowed</li>
<li class="bottom-bar">Send up to 10 GB</li>
<li class="bottom-bar">Unlimited</li>
```

**Change Buttons**

You can add your won text on the buttons and you can replace the link to your package with your details, to do so alter:

```html
<li>
  <a href="https://carrdme.com"><div class="btn">Learn More</div></a>
</li>
```

### 3. Add the code to Carrd.co

After you customize the code you will need to go to the carrd website and add a container, in that container you can add the `embed` widget, give it a name and paste the code. You can align the text as you link and ad spacing for the container.

### 4. Save and check the modifications

What remains is to save your project and see how is looking, just publish the design and see how is looking, If there are issues you can alter the width of the container and make some customizations in carrd interface.
