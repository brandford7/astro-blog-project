In the ever-evolving world of software development and deployment, containerization has emerged as a game-changing technology. It's revolutionized the way we build, ship, and run applications, making it easier than ever to create consistent environments across different platforms. Let's dive into the fascinating world of containers and explore two of the most prominent players in this space: Docker and Podman.

## Background on containerization

Containerization is like packing your entire application and its dependencies into a neat, portable box. Imagine you're moving to a new house, and instead of packing everything separately, you could just pick up your entire room and plop it down in your new place, exactly as it was. That's essentially what containerization does for software!

This technology has its roots in the concept of operating system-level virtualization, which dates back to the early 2000s. However, it wasn't until the [2010s](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/whats-a-linux-container) that containerization really took off, thanks to advancements in Linux kernel features like cgroups and namespaces.

The benefits of containerization are numerous:

- **Consistency**: Containers ensure that applications run the same way, regardless of where they're deployed.
- **Efficiency**: They're lightweight and start up quickly, using fewer resources than traditional virtual machines.
- **Scalability**: Containers make it easy to scale applications up or down as needed.
- **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own environment, reducing conflicts between applications.

These advantages have led to widespread adoption of containerization across various industries. According to a 2021 survey by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, 92% of organizations were using containers in production, up from 84% the previous year. This rapid growth underscores the transformative impact of containerization on modern software development and deployment practices.

## Rise of Docker and emergence of Podman

When we talk about containerization, it's almost impossible not to mention Docker. Launched in 2013, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) quickly became synonymous with containers, much like how "Googling" became the go-to term for internet searches. Docker's user-friendly interface and robust ecosystem made containerization accessible to a broader range of developers and organizations.

Some key milestones in Docker's rise include:

- 2013: Docker is released as an open-source project
- 2014: Google, IBM, and other tech giants announce support for Docker

- 2017: Docker Enterprise Edition is launched

Docker's popularity soared, and it became the de facto standard for containerization. However, as with any technology that gains widespread adoption, alternatives began to emerge. One such alternative is Podman.

[Podman](https://podman.io/), short for Pod Manager, was introduced by Red Hat in 2018 as a daemonless container engine. It was designed to be a more secure and lightweight alternative to Docker, addressing some of the concerns that had arisen around Docker's architecture.

Key features of Podman include:

- Daemonless architecture
- Rootless containers
- OCI (Open Container Initiative) compliance
- Compatibility with Docker commands

Podman's emergence has sparked interest in the developer community, particularly among those concerned with security and those working in enterprise environments. While Docker still holds a significant market share, Podman has been gaining traction, especially in Linux-based environments.

## Importance of comparing container technologies

As the containerization landscape evolves, it's crucial for developers, DevOps engineers, and organizations to understand the differences between various container technologies. Here's why:

1. **Informed decision-making**: Choosing the right container technology can significantly impact your development workflow, deployment processes, and overall system performance.

5. **Future-proofing**: As the container ecosystem evolves, staying informed about different technologies helps you adapt to future changes and trends.

To illustrate the importance of comparing container technologies, let's look at a brief comparison of Docker and Podman:

| Feature           | Docker                    | Podman                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Architecture      | Client-server with daemon | Daemonless                   |
| Root privileges   | Required for daemon       | Supports rootless containers |
| OCI compliance    | Yes                       | Yes                          |
| Container runtime | containerd                | crun or runc                 |
| Orchestration     | Docker Swarm (built-in)   | Kubernetes (via Podman pods) |
| Image building    | Dockerfile                | Dockerfile (compatible)      |

This table highlights some key differences between Docker and Podman, demonstrating why it's essential to compare these technologies. For instance, an organization prioritizing security might lean towards Podman's rootless containers, while another valuing Docker's extensive ecosystem might prefer to stick with Docker.

In the rapidly evolving world of containerization, staying informed about different technologies is not just beneficialâ€”it's necessary. As Gartner predicts, the container management market is expected to grow to $944 million by 2024, indicating the continued importance of these technologies in the software development landscape.

By understanding the nuances of different container technologies, developers and organizations can make informed decisions that align with their specific needs, workflows, and long-term goals. Whether you're a seasoned DevOps engineer or a developer just starting to explore containerization, comparing technologies like Docker and Podman is an invaluable exercise in staying current and making the most of these powerful tools.

As we delve deeper into the specifics of Docker and Podman in the following sections, keep in mind that the goal is not to declare a winner, but to provide you with the knowledge to choose the right tool for your unique circumstances. After all, in the world of technology, one size rarely fits all!

## Container Basics: Docker and Podman Overview

In the world of containerization, two names stand out: Docker and Podman. Both offer powerful solutions for managing containers, but they have distinct features and philosophies. Let's take a closer look at these containerization titans and see how they compare.

### What is Docker?

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is the pioneer that popularized containerization in the software industry. Launched in 2013, it quickly became synonymous with containers, transforming how developers build, package, and deploy applications.

#### Key features and architecture

Docker's architecture is built around a client-server model, consisting of three main components:

1. Docker Client: The command-line interface (CLI) that users interact with.
2. Docker Daemon: The background service that manages Docker objects.
3. Docker Registry: A repository for storing and sharing Docker images.

Some of Docker's key features include:

- **Easy-to-use CLI**: Docker's intuitive command-line interface makes it accessible for beginners and powerful for experts.
- **Docker Hub**: A vast repository of pre-built container images, both official and community-contributed.
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container applications.
- **Docker Swarm**: Built-in orchestration for managing clusters of Docker containers.

#### Docker's role in containerization history

Docker's impact on the tech industry cannot be overstated. It popularized the concept of containerization, making it accessible to a wide range of developers and organizations. According to the [2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-platforms-all-respondents5), Docker was used by 35.6% of professional developers, showcasing its widespread adoption.

Docker's influence extends beyond its own ecosystem. It played a crucial role in the development of industry standards like the [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/), which aims to create open industry standards around container formats and runtimes.

### What is Podman?

[Podman](https://podman.io/), short for Pod Manager, is a more recent entrant in the containerization space. Developed by Red Hat, Podman offers a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running OCI containers.

#### Key features and architecture

Podman's architecture differs significantly from Docker's:

- **Daemonless**: Podman doesn't require a background daemon to run, enhancing security and reducing resource usage.
- **Rootless containers**: Podman can run containers without root privileges, improving security.
- **Pod support**: Native support for pods, a concept borrowed from Kubernetes.

Some of Podman's standout features include:

- **Docker compatibility**: Podman can often be used as a drop-in replacement for Docker, with a compatible CLI.
- **Systemd integration**: Containers can be managed as systemd services.
- **Kubernetes integration**: Generate Kubernetes YAML from Podman containers and pods.

#### Red Hat's motivation for developing Podman

Red Hat developed Podman as part of its push towards more secure and flexible containerization solutions. The company wanted to address some of the limitations and potential security issues associated with Docker's architecture, particularly the reliance on a privileged daemon process.

According to Dan Walsh, a Red Hat engineer, in a [blog post](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/02/21/podman-and-buildah-for-docker-users/): "We wanted to build a tool that could be used to run containers in HPC environments, in CI/CD systems, and even potentially as a back end for Kubernetes CRI."

### Similarities between Docker and Podman

Despite their differences, Docker and Podman share several similarities, making it easier for users to switch between the two or use them in complementary ways.

#### OCI compliance

Both Docker and Podman are compliant with the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards. This means that container images created with one tool can be run by the other, ensuring interoperability and preventing vendor lock-in.

The OCI compliance covers two main specifications:

1. Runtime Specification (runtime-spec)
2. Image Specification (image-spec)

This standardization has been crucial for the growth of the containerization ecosystem, allowing for a rich variety of tools and platforms that can work together seamlessly.

#### Command-line interface compatibility

One of Podman's design goals was to maintain CLI compatibility with Docker. This means that in many cases, you can simply alias `docker` to `podman` and continue using your existing Docker commands and scripts.

Here's a comparison of some common commands:

| Action          | Docker         | Podman         |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Run a container | `docker run`   | `podman run`   |
| List containers | `docker ps`    | `podman ps`    |
| Build an image  | `docker build` | `podman build` |
| Pull an image   | `docker pull`  | `podman pull`  |

This compatibility makes it easier for teams to transition from Docker to Podman if they choose to do so, reducing the learning curve and minimizing disruption to existing workflows.

While Docker and Podman share these similarities, it's important to note that they are not identical. Podman introduces some unique concepts and commands, particularly around rootless containers and pod management, which don't have direct equivalents in Docker.

As containerization continues to evolve, both Docker and Podman are playing crucial roles in shaping the future of software deployment and management. Docker's pioneering work laid the foundation for the containerization revolution, while Podman represents the next generation of container engines, focusing on enhanced security and flexibility.

Whether you choose Docker, Podman, or a combination of both, understanding these tools is crucial for modern software development and deployment. As the container ecosystem continues to grow and mature, we can expect to see even more innovations and improvements in how we build, ship, and run applications.

## Architectural Differences

When it comes to containerization technologies, the architectural design plays a crucial role in determining performance, security, and ease of use. Docker and Podman, while both serving similar purposes, take fundamentally different approaches to their architecture. Let's explore these differences and their implications.

### Docker's client-server model

Docker, the pioneer in popularizing containerization, employs a client-server architecture. This model has been the foundation of Docker's functionality since its inception.

#### Docker daemon and its role

At the heart of Docker's architecture lies the Docker daemon, a background process that manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. The daemon listens for Docker API requests and processes them, acting as the control center for all Docker-related operations.

The [Docker daemon](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/dockerd/) (dockerd) runs with root privileges, which allows it to perform system-level operations necessary for container management. Users interact with Docker through the Docker CLI (Command Line Interface), which communicates with the daemon to execute commands.

#### Advantages and disadvantages of daemon-based architecture

**Advantages:**

- Centralized management: The daemon provides a single point of control for all Docker operations.
- Performance: For certain operations, the daemon can offer improved performance due to its persistent nature.
- Feature-rich: The daemon architecture allows for easy implementation of advanced features like Docker Swarm for orchestration.

**Disadvantages:**

- Security concerns: Running with root privileges poses potential security risks.
- Single point of failure: If the daemon crashes, all Docker operations are affected.
- Resource overhead: The daemon consumes system resources even when not actively managing containers.

### Podman's daemonless approach

In contrast to Docker, Podman takes a radically different approach with its daemonless architecture. This design choice sets Podman apart and addresses some of the concerns associated with Docker's daemon-based model.

#### Fork-exec model

Podman utilizes a fork-exec model, where each Podman command runs as a separate process. When you execute a Podman command, it forks a new process to handle the operation and then exits once the task is complete. This approach is more in line with traditional Unix philosophy.

The Podman architecture doesn't require a persistent background process, which means it can run without elevated privileges for most operations.

#### Benefits of daemonless architecture

- **Enhanced security:** Podman can run in rootless mode, reducing the attack surface and potential vulnerabilities.
- **Improved stability:** Without a central daemon, there's no single point of failure that could affect all container operations.
- **Resource efficiency:** System resources are only used when Podman commands are actively running.
- **Simplified debugging:** Each operation runs as a separate process, making it easier to trace and debug issues.

### Impact on system resource usage

The architectural differences between Docker and Podman have significant implications for system resource usage. Let's compare their impact on memory footprint and CPU utilization.

#### Memory footprint comparison

Docker's daemon-based architecture results in a constant memory overhead, as the daemon runs continuously in the background. In contrast, Podman's daemonless approach means it only consumes memory when actively executing commands.

Here's a simplified comparison of memory usage:

| Scenario                     | Docker               | Podman                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Idle (no containers running) | ~50-100 MB           | 0 MB                              |
| Running a single container   | ~100-150 MB          | ~50 MB                            |
| Multiple containers          | Incremental increase | Proportional to active containers |

These figures are approximate and can vary based on system configuration and workload. However, they illustrate the general trend of Podman's more efficient memory usage, especially in idle states.

#### CPU utilization differences

CPU utilization patterns also differ between Docker and Podman:

- **Docker:** The daemon consumes a small amount of CPU even when idle. During container operations, CPU usage spikes as the daemon processes requests.
- **Podman:** CPU usage is typically zero when no commands are running. During operations, CPU utilization is similar to Docker but limited to the duration of the command execution.

A study by Red Hat compared the performance of Podman and Docker in various scenarios. They found that while both tools performed similarly for most container operations, Podman had a slight edge in CPU efficiency, particularly for operations involving multiple containers.

### Key takeaways:

- Docker's daemon-based architecture offers centralized management but comes with security concerns and constant resource overhead.
- Podman's daemonless approach provides enhanced security and resource efficiency at the cost of some advanced features.
- Memory usage is generally lower with Podman, especially when containers are not actively running.
- CPU utilization is more sporadic with Podman, aligning closely with actual command execution.

The choice between Docker and Podman often comes down to specific use cases and priorities. For environments where security and resource efficiency are paramount, Podman's architecture offers clear advantages. However, Docker's rich ecosystem and advanced features may still make it the preferred choice for many developers and organizations.

As containerization continues to evolve, it's exciting to see how these architectural approaches influence the development of new features and best practices in the industry. Whether you choose Docker or Podman, understanding these architectural differences will help you make informed decisions about your containerization strategy and optimize your development workflow.

## Security Considerations

When it comes to container management, security is paramount. Both Docker and Podman offer robust security features, but their approaches differ in significant ways. Let's explore the security considerations for each platform, focusing on root privileges, user namespaces, SELinux integration, and overall vulnerability surface.

### Root privileges and container management

#### Docker's root-based approach

Docker has traditionally relied on a root-based approach for container management. This means that the Docker daemon runs with root privileges, which can be a double-edged sword:

- **Pros:**
  - Simplified management and deployment
  - Full access to system resources
- **Cons:**
  - Increased security risk if the daemon is compromised
  - Potential for unintended system-wide changes

According to a [2019 Snyk report](https://snyk.io/blog/10-docker-image-security-best-practices/), 44% of Docker images contain known vulnerabilities, highlighting the importance of careful management when using root privileges.

#### Podman's rootless containers

Podman takes a different approach, offering rootless containers as a default:

- **Pros:**
  - Reduced attack surface
  - Better isolation between containers and host system
  - Improved compliance with security policies
- **Cons:**
  - Some limitations on functionality without root access

A [Red Hat survey](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/why-red-hat-investing-cri-o-and-podman) found that 56% of respondents cited security as a primary concern when adopting container technologies, making Podman's rootless approach particularly appealing.

### User namespace implementation

#### How Podman leverages user namespaces

Podman makes extensive use of user namespaces to enhance security:

- Containers run with unprivileged user IDs
- UID/GID mapping between container and host
- Reduced risk of container breakout attacks

This approach aligns with the principle of least privilege, a cornerstone of modern security practices.

#### Docker's rootless mode vs. Podman's native approach

While Docker has introduced a rootless mode, it's not the default configuration:

| Feature                | Docker                                 | Podman                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Default mode           | Root-based                             | Rootless              |
| User namespace support | Available in rootless mode             | Native implementation |
| Ease of use            | Requires additional setup for rootless | Works out of the box  |

Podman's native rootless approach provides a more seamless experience for users prioritizing security.

### SELinux integration

#### Podman's native SELinux support

Podman offers robust, native support for SELinux (Security-Enhanced Linux):

- Automatic labeling of container processes and files
- Fine-grained access control policies
- Seamless integration with existing SELinux configurations

This integration helps organizations maintain compliance with security standards like [NIST SP 800-190](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-190.pdf), which provides guidelines for application container security.

#### Docker's SELinux implementation

Docker also supports SELinux, but the implementation differs:

- Requires additional configuration
- May need custom SELinux policies for complex setups
- Can be disabled, potentially leading to security gaps

A StackRox survey found that 94% of respondents experienced a security incident in their Kubernetes environments in the past 12 months, underscoring the importance of robust security measures like SELinux integration.

### Vulnerability surface comparison

#### Attack vectors in daemon-based vs. daemonless architectures

The architectural differences between Docker and Podman have significant implications for their vulnerability surfaces:

**Docker (daemon-based):**

- Central daemon is a potential single point of failure
- Larger attack surface due to always-running process
- Vulnerabilities in the daemon could affect all containers

**Podman (daemonless):**

- No central daemon to exploit
- Reduced attack surface
- Each container runs as a separate process

To illustrate this difference, consider the following table:

| Aspect                    | Docker        | Podman             |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Central process           | Docker daemon | None (daemonless)  |
| Process isolation         | Shared daemon | Separate processes |
| Privilege escalation risk | Higher        | Lower              |

#### Case studies of security incidents

While specific security incidents are often kept confidential, we can look at some general trends and examples:

1. **CVE-2019-5736:** This vulnerability in runc, which affected both Docker and other container runtimes, allowed attackers to gain root-level access on the host. Podman's rootless approach would have mitigated this risk.

2. **Docker socket exposure:** Misconfigured Docker sockets have led to numerous security incidents. In 2018, Tesla's cloud infrastructure was compromised due to an exposed Docker API, resulting in cryptocurrency mining on their Kubernetes cluster.

3. **Container escape vulnerabilities:** Researchers have demonstrated various container escape techniques in Docker environments. While these often require specific conditions, they highlight the importance of defense-in-depth strategies.

It's worth noting that both Docker and Podman teams actively work to address vulnerabilities and improve security. The [Docker Security](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/) documentation and Podman Security guide provide detailed information on best practices and ongoing efforts to enhance container security.

In conclusion, while both Docker and Podman offer strong security features, Podman's rootless approach, native user namespace implementation, and seamless SELinux integration provide a more security-focused default configuration. However, with proper setup and adherence to best practices, both platforms can be used to create secure container environments.

As container adoption continues to growâ€”with [Gartner predicting](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2020-06-25-gartner-forecasts-strong-revenue-growth-for-global-co) that by 2022, more than 75% of global organizations will be running containerized applications in productionâ€”understanding these security considerations becomes increasingly crucial for developers and operations teams alike.

## Performance and Scalability

When it comes to containerization tools, performance and scalability are crucial factors that can make or break your development and deployment processes. In this section, we'll dive deep into how Docker and Podman stack up against each other in these critical areas.

### Image Building Performance

The speed at which container images can be built is a key consideration for developers and DevOps teams. Both Docker and Podman have their own approaches to image building, each with its unique advantages.

#### Docker's BuildKit vs. Podman's Buildah

Docker introduced [BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/) as an improved image building solution, offering faster build times and more efficient caching. On the other hand, Podman utilizes [Buildah](https://buildah.io/), a flexible and powerful tool for building OCI-compliant container images.

- BuildKit advantages:

  - Concurrent and distributed building
  - Improved caching mechanisms
  - Automatic garbage collection

- Buildah advantages:
  - Rootless image building
  - Fine-grained control over image layers
  - Integration with other tools in the container ecosystem

#### Benchmark Comparisons

While specific benchmarks can vary depending on the complexity of the image and the hardware used, some general observations can be made:

| Aspect             | Docker (BuildKit)                               | Podman (Buildah)                                       |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Build Speed        | Generally faster for complex multi-stage builds | Competitive performance, especially for simpler images |
| Caching Efficiency | Excellent, with intelligent layer caching       | Good, with improving caching mechanisms                |
| Resource Usage     | Efficient use of system resources               | Lightweight, with minimal overhead                     |

It's worth noting that the Red Hat team has reported comparable or better performance with Podman and Buildah in many scenarios, particularly when building images without root privileges.

### Container Startup Times

The time it takes for a container to start can significantly impact application responsiveness and scalability, especially in dynamic environments where containers are frequently spun up and down.

#### Impact of Architecture on Initialization

Docker's architecture involves a daemon that manages containers, while Podman uses a daemonless approach. This fundamental difference can affect startup times:

- Docker:

  - The daemon can provide quicker startup for subsequent containers
  - Initial daemon startup may add overhead

- Podman:
  - No daemon overhead
  - Potentially faster cold starts

#### Real-world Performance Tests

In real-world scenarios, the differences in startup times between Docker and Podman are often negligible for most applications. However, in high-performance environments where milliseconds matter, these small differences can add up.

A study by SUSE found that Podman showed slightly faster container creation times compared to Docker in certain scenarios, particularly when running multiple containers simultaneously.

### Resource Isolation and Management

Effective resource isolation and management are critical for maintaining performance and security in containerized environments.

#### cgroups Implementation in Docker and Podman

Both Docker and Podman utilize Linux control groups (cgroups) for resource management, but with some differences:

- Docker:

  - Uses cgroups v1 by default
  - Transition to cgroups v2 is ongoing

- Podman:
  - Native support for cgroups v2
  - Better integration with systemd

#### Fine-grained Control over Container Resources

Both tools offer ways to control resource allocation, but Podman's integration with cgroups v2 can provide more granular control:

| Feature           | Docker  | Podman                     |
| ----------------- | ------- | -------------------------- |
| CPU Limits        | Yes     | Yes                        |
| Memory Limits     | Yes     | Yes                        |
| I/O Throttling    | Yes     | Yes                        |
| Per-device Limits | Limited | Advanced (with cgroups v2) |

Podman's use of cgroups v2 allows for more precise resource management, which can be particularly beneficial in multi-tenant environments or when running resource-intensive applications.

### Scalability in Production Environments

As applications grow and demand increases, the ability to scale containerized workloads becomes paramount.

#### Docker Swarm vs. Podman Pods

For native clustering and orchestration:

- Docker Swarm:

  - Integrated into Docker
  - Easy to set up and use
  - Good for smaller to medium-sized deployments

- Podman Pods:
  - Kubernetes-like pod abstraction
  - Better alignment with Kubernetes concepts
  - Suitable for transitioning to full Kubernetes deployments

While Docker Swarm provides a straightforward path to clustering, Podman's approach with pods offers a more Kubernetes-friendly solution, which can be advantageous for teams planning to scale to full-fledged Kubernetes environments.

#### Integration with Orchestration Tools

Both Docker and Podman integrate well with Kubernetes, the de facto standard for container orchestration at scale:

- Docker:

  - Long-standing integration with Kubernetes
  - Widely used in Kubernetes environments

- Podman:
  - Native support for Kubernetes YAML
  - Seamless transition between local development and Kubernetes clusters

The [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) project has been moving away from Docker-specific components, which has somewhat leveled the playing field between Docker and alternative runtimes like those used by Podman.

In conclusion, both Docker and Podman offer strong performance and scalability features. Docker's maturity and widespread adoption give it an edge in terms of ecosystem and tooling support. However, Podman's daemonless architecture, advanced resource management capabilities, and closer alignment with Kubernetes concepts make it an increasingly attractive option, especially for teams focused on security and looking for a smooth path to large-scale Kubernetes deployments.

The choice between Docker and Podman often comes down to specific use cases, existing infrastructure, and team expertise. As both tools continue to evolve, staying informed about their latest features and performance improvements is crucial for making the best decision for your containerization needs.

## Developer Experience and Ecosystem

When it comes to containerization tools, the developer experience and ecosystem play a crucial role in adoption and efficiency. Both Docker and Podman have made significant strides in this area, but they approach it in slightly different ways. Let's explore how these two platforms compare in terms of their command-line interfaces, integration with development workflows, image compatibility, and community support.

### Command-line interface comparison

The command-line interface (CLI) is often the primary way developers interact with containerization tools. Both Docker and Podman have put considerable effort into making their CLIs user-friendly and powerful.

#### Syntax similarities and differences

Docker and Podman have intentionally similar syntaxes, which is great news for developers looking to switch between the two or use them interchangeably. This similarity is not by accident; Podman was designed to be a drop-in replacement for Docker in many scenarios. Here's a quick comparison of some common commands:

| Action          | Docker         | Podman         |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Run a container | `docker run`   | `podman run`   |
| List containers | `docker ps`    | `podman ps`    |
| Build an image  | `docker build` | `podman build` |
| Pull an image   | `docker pull`  | `podman pull`  |

As you can see, in many cases, you can simply replace "docker" with "podman" in your commands, and they'll work as expected. This similarity extends to most of the basic container operations, making the transition between the two tools relatively smooth.

#### Unique features of each CLI

While the basic syntax is similar, each CLI has its own unique features:
