## Installation
Choose your operating system and follow these simple steps:

### Linux:
```bash
cargo install oha
```

```

## Basic Usage

### Simple Test Command:
```bash
oha https://yourwebsite.com
```

### Common Options Table:
| Option | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| -n | Total requests | oha -n 200 https://site.com |
| -c | Concurrent users | oha -c 50 https://site.com |
| -q | Requests per second | oha -q 100 https://site.com |
| --no-tui | Disable visual interface | oha --no-tui https://site.com |

### Understanding Test Results

Let's analyze a typical output:
```sh
Summary:
  Success rate: 100.00%
  Total:        0.6689 secs
  Slowest:      0.4123 secs
  Fastest:      0.0733 secs
  Average:      0.1557 secs
  Requests/sec: 299.0098
```

Key Metrics Explained:
| Metric | What It Means | Good Values |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Success rate | Percentage of successful requests | Should be close to 100% |
| Average time | Mean response time | Under 1 second |
| Requests/sec | Throughput capacity | Depends on your needs |
| Slowest | Worst response time | Should not be more than 3x average |

### Response Time Distribution
The percentile breakdown shows how your site performs across all requests:
- 50th percentile (median): Normal user experience
- 90th percentile: Slower but acceptable responses
- 99th percentile: Worst-case scenarios


**Real Output:**

```sh

  DNS-lookup:   0.0001 secs, 0.0000 secs, 0.0005 secs

Status code distribution:
  [200] 200 responses
```

## Basic Testing Scenarios

1. **Quick Health Check**
```bash
oha -n 100 https://yoursite.com
```
Purpose: Quick overview of site performance

2. **Load Testing**
```bash
oha -n 1000 -c 50 https://yoursite.com
```
Purpose: Simulate multiple concurrent users

3. **Stress Testing**
```bash
oha -n 2000 -c 100 -q 200 https://yoursite.com
```
Purpose: Find performance limits


## Real-World Testing Examples

### 1. Testing API Endpoints
```bash
oha -n 500 -c 50 -m POST -T "application/json" -d '{"key":"value"}' https://api.yoursite.com/endpoint
```

API Testing Parameters:
| Parameter | Description | Usage |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| -m POST | HTTP method | For API calls |
| -T | Content type | Specify data format |
| -d | Request body | Send data |

### 2. Simulating Peak Traffic
```bash
oha -n 2000 -c 100 --disable-keepalive https://yoursite.com
```

Peak Traffic Settings:
- Higher concurrent connections (-c)
- Disabled keepalive for realism
- Larger number of requests (-n)

## Interpreting Results

### Performance Metrics Table
| Metric | Good | Warning | Critical |
|--------|------|---------|-----------|
| Response Time | < 1s | 1-3s | > 3s |
| Success Rate | > 99% | 95-99% | < 95% |
| Requests/sec | Site-specific | 20% drop | > 30% drop |

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **High Response Times**
- Possible Causes:
  - Server resources maxed out
  - Database bottlenecks
  - Unoptimized code
- Solutions:
  - Implement caching
  - Optimize database queries
  - Scale server resources

2. **Failed Requests**
- Possible Causes:
  - Server timeout
  - Rate limiting
  - Network issues
- Solutions:
  - Increase timeout values
  - Adjust rate limits
  - Check network configuration

## Best Practices for Load Testing

### Do's and Don'ts

✅ Do:
- Start with small tests
- Test during low-traffic periods
- Monitor server resources
- Test regularly
- Document results

❌ Don't:
- Test production without warning
- Run tests from production servers
- Ignore error rates
- Test single endpoints only
