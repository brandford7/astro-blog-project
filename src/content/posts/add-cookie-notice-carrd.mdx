A cookie notice is an important aspect of any website because it informs visitors about the use of cookies on the site. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's device when they visit a website. They can be used to track user behavior, personalize content, and remember user preferences. However, because cookies collect personal data, their use is regulated by data protection laws such as GDPR and CCPA.

A cookie notice informs visitors that cookies are being used on the website and provides information on what data is being collected, why it is being collected, and how it will be used. This allows users to make an informed decision about whether or not they want to consent to the use of cookies.

Implementing a cookie notice is not only a legal requirement in many jurisdictions, but it also helps to build trust with website visitors. It shows that the website owner respects their privacy and is transparent about how their data is being used. Without a cookie notice, website owners risk facing legal penalties and losing the trust of their visitors. Therefore, it is important for website owners to implement a cookie notice to ensure compliance with data protection laws and to build trust with their users.

```html
<p id="cookie-notice">
  This website uses cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our
  website<br /><button onclick="acceptCookie();">Got it!</button>
</p>

<style>
  #cookie-notice {
    color: #fff;
    font-family: inherit;
    background: #596cd5;
    padding: 20px;
    position: fixed;
    bottom: 10px;

    width: 100%;
    max-width: 300px;
    box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
    border-radius: 5px;
    margin: 0px;
    visibility: hidden;
    z-index: 1000000;
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  #cookie-notice button {
    color: inherit;
    background: #3842c7;
    border: 0;
    padding: 10px;
    margin-top: 10px;
    width: 100%;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    #cookie-notice {
      max-width: 100%;
      bottom: 0;
      left: 0;
      border-radius: 0;
    }
  }
</style>

<script>
  function acceptCookie() {
    (document.cookie =
      "cookieaccepted=1; expires=" +
      new Date(Date.now() + 86400000).toUTCString() +
      "; path=/"),
      (document.getElementById("cookie-notice").style.visibility = "hidden");
  }
  document.cookie.indexOf("cookieaccepted") < 0 &&
    (document.getElementById("cookie-notice").style.visibility = "visible");
</script>
```

This code is used to display a cookie notice on a website and to set a cookie when the user accepts the notice.

<Button link="https://try.carrd.co/bitdoze" text="Carrd.co" />

The code first creates a paragraph element with an ID of "cookie-notice" that contains a message informing the user that the website uses cookies and a button labeled "Got it!" that the user can click to accept the notice.

The code then defines a style for the "cookie-notice" element, which sets the background color, font color, padding, position, width, and other properties of the notice. The style also sets the visibility of the notice to "hidden" by default.

The code then defines a JavaScript function called "acceptCookie" that is called when the user clicks the "Got it!" button. The function sets a cookie named "cookieaccepted" with a value of "1" and an expiration date of 1 day. The function also sets the visibility of the "cookie-notice" element to "hidden" so that it disappears from the webpage.

Finally, the code checks if the "cookieaccepted" cookie has already been set by checking if the string "cookieaccepted" appears in the "document.cookie" string. If the cookie has not been set, the code sets the visibility of the "cookie-notice" element to "visible" so that it appears on the webpage.
