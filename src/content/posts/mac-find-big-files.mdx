Finding and managing large files on your Mac is crucial for maintaining optimal performance and storage space. Over time, various files can consume significant disk space:
- Video files and media projects
- Virtual machine images
- Large application installers
- Old backup files
- Downloaded content

This guide will show you how to efficiently identify and manage large files using a simple Bash script, helping you reclaim valuable storage space on your Mac.

## Common Methods for Finding Large Files

### Built-in Tools
macOS provides several built-in options for managing storage:
1. **About This Mac > Storage**: Offers a general overview but lacks detailed file information
2. **Finder's storage management**: Good for basic cleanup but not comprehensive
3. **Disk Utility**: Primarily for disk management rather than file size analysis

### Third-Party Applications
While there are many paid applications available for disk space management, they often:
- Require installation and regular updates
- May include unnecessary features
- Could impact system performance
- Usually come with a subscription cost

This is why a simple script can be more efficient and cost-effective.

## How to Find the Biggest Files on Your Mac

### Script

The following Bash script is designed to identify and display the largest files on your Mac. It searches through your file system while excluding certain directories that typically contain system files or temporary data.

```sh
#!/bin/bash

# Default number of files to show if not specified
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
    num_files=20
else
    num_files=$1
fi

# Print disk space information
echo "==========================================="
echo "DISK SPACE INFORMATION"
echo "==========================================="
df -h / | awk 'NR==2 {
    printf "Total Space: %s\n", $2
    printf "Used Space:  %s\n", $3
    printf "Free Space:  %s\n", $4
    printf "Usage:       %s\n", $5
}'
echo "==========================================="
echo

# Print script start message
echo "Searching for the $num_files largest files on your Mac..."
echo "This may take a while depending on your system size..."
echo "You may be prompted for sudo password to search all directories"

# Create temporary file to store results
tmp_file=$(mktemp)

# Use sudo to ensure we can access all directories
# Exclude system directories that might cause issues
sudo find / \                                                                                                                                                             -not \( -path "/System/*" -prune \) \
    -not \( -path "/private/var/vm/*" -prune \) \
    -not \( -path "/Library/Caches/*" -prune \) \
    -type f -print0 2>/dev/null | \
    xargs -0 du -h 2>/dev/null | \
    sort -rh | \
    head -n "$num_files" > "$tmp_file"

# Clear screen and print results in a formatted way
echo "==========================================="
echo "TOP $num_files LARGEST FILES ON YOUR SYSTEM"
echo "==========================================="
echo
echo "Size  |  File Path"
echo "-------------------------------------------"
while read -r line; do
    size=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $1}')
    file=$(echo "$line" | cut -f2-)
    printf "%-6s | %s\n" "$size" "$file"
done < "$tmp_file"
echo "==========================================="

# Clean up temporary file
rm "$tmp_file"

echo "Scan complete!"
```

### Run the Script

To run this script:

1. **Open Terminal**: You can find Terminal in Applications > Utilities or by searching for it using Spotlight (Cmd + Space).

2. **Create a New Script File**:
   ```sh
   nano find_large_files.sh
   ```
   Paste the script into the editor and save it by pressing `CTRL + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`.

3. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```sh
   chmod +x find_large_files.sh
   ```

4. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script by typing:
   ```sh
   ./find_large_files.sh [number_of_files]
   ```
   Replace `[number_of_files]` with how many of the largest files you want to display (default is 20).
   In this process you will be promted for a password and will be asked to give various wrights to the terminal to make queries.

5. **View Results**: The script will display disk space information followed by a list of the largest files found on your Mac.
  ```sh
  ===========================================
  DISK SPACE INFORMATION
  ===========================================
  Total Space: 460Gi
  Used Space:  10Gi
  Free Space:  369Gi
  Usage:       3%
  ===========================================

  Searching for the 20 largest files on your Mac...
  This may take a while depending on your system size...
  You may be prompted for sudo password to search all directories
  Password:
  Sorry, try again.
