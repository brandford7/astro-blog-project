## LiteLLM Deploy Options

When deploying LiteLLM using Docker Compose, there are notable differences between deploying with and without a database.

### Deployment Without a Database

- **Configuration Simplicity**: Deploying LiteLLM without a database involves fewer components, making the setup process simpler. You primarily need to configure the application using a configuration file (`litellm_config.yaml`) and run the Docker container with necessary environment variables and ports. We are going to see below.
- **Use Cases**: This setup is suitable for scenarios where persistent data storage is not required, or the application can function with in-memory data or external APIs.

### Deployment With a Database

- **Database Requirement**: When deploying with a database, you need to set up a Postgres database and provide a `DATABASE_URL` in the environment variables. This setup is essential for applications that require persistent data storage.
- **Additional Configuration**: You must configure the database connection details in the environment variables and ensure that the database service is up and running before the application starts. This might involve using Docker Compose to define the startup order.
- **Data Persistence**: Using a database allows for persistent data storage, which is crucial for applications that handle significant amounts of data or require data integrity over time. It is important to use Docker volumes to ensure data is not lost when containers are stopped or removed.
- **Complexity and Management**: Deploying with a database adds complexity, as you need to manage database backups, scaling, and performance tuning. It is recommended to use separate containers for the database and application to maintain a clean separation of concerns and facilitate easier management.

In summary, deploying LiteLLM with a database provides the advantage of data persistence and is suitable for production environments, while deploying without a database is simpler and more suited for development or scenarios where persistent storage is not critical.

    volumes:
      - ./ollama-local:/root/.ollama
  litellm:
    image: ghcr.io/berriai/litellm:main-latest
    networks:
      - traefik-net
    restart: unless-stopped
    command:
      - --config=/litellm_config.yaml
      - --detailed_debug
    environment:
      LITELLM_MASTER_KEY: ${LITELLM_MASTER_KEY}
      OPENAI_API_KEY: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}
    volumes:
