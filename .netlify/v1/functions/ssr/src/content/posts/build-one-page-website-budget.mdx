### Astro js

Astro is a web framework that lets you build fast and scalable websites with your favorite UI library. Astro can render your pages to static HTML for better performance, SEO, and accessibility. You can also use Astro to create dynamic web applications and APIs with any backend service. Astro supports multiple UI frameworks, such as React, Svelte, Vue, and more.

### Static WordPress Website

WordPress is one of the most popular and versatile platforms for creating websites. However, WordPress websites can also be slow, insecure, and expensive to host, especially if you don’t need a lot of dynamic features or content.

That’s why some people prefer to use static WordPress websites, which are WordPress websites that are converted into static HTML files and hosted on a server that only serves static files. Static WordPress websites are faster, more secure, and cheaper to host than regular WordPress websites, and they are ideal for one-page websites that don’t require a lot of updates or interactions.

You can create and host a static WordPress website on a budget using Kinsta Static, a hosting service that specializes in static WordPress websites. You can use free themes or build your own layout with the help of free WordPress resources and host them on Static website platforms like Kinsta Static, CloudFlare Pages, Vercel or Netlify.
