## Benefits of SVG

Scalable Vector Graphics, or SVG, is a file format used for 2D graphics on the Web. It is an XML-based format and can be edited with any text editor. One of the main advantages of SVG is its scalability, which means it can be scaled to any size without losing quality. This makes it an excellent option for responsive web design.

Another benefit of SVG is its small file size. Unlike raster images, which are made up of pixels, SVG files are created using mathematical equations that define shapes and lines. As a result, they have smaller file sizes than JPEGs or PNGs of the same dimensions. This not only improves Web page loading times but also reduces the strain on server resources.

SVG also offers superior image clarity and sharpness compared to other image formats because it is resolution-independent.

## Vectorizer.ai Overview

[Vectorizer.ai](https://vectorizer.ai/) is an innovative platform that allows users to convert their raster images into high-quality vector graphics. With its powerful AI algorithms, Vectorizer.ai can accurately identify and trace the edges of any image to create a smooth and scalable vector graphic.

One of the main advantages of Vectorizer.ai is its ease of use. The platform is incredibly user-friendly and intuitive, which means that even novice users can quickly learn how it works. In addition, the software supports a wide range of raster image formats, including JPEGs, PNGs, GIFs, BMPs and more, meaning that you can convert just about any digital image into a vector graphic with this tool.

Vectorizer.ai also has an API that can be used to convert your images to SVG, currently in beta and free to use.

## How to use Vectorizer.ai to convert images to SVG

The process is simple, you just need to navigate to their website select the image you want and upload it, their AI will take care of the rest and create the SVG image for you. I used it to convert my logo for bitdoze.com and it did a very nice job, also I converted the plausible.io logo to SVG which is more complex and the results were very good.

You can check out the video below to see how it did with the plausible.io logo.
