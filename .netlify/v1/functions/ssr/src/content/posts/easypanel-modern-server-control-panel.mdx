## Easypanel.io Installation

In the next part, we are going to see how we can deploy our Easypanel installation on a Hetzner VPS and start deploying apps and templates to the server.

  label="Easypanel.io Installation"
/>

### 1.Deploy a Hetzner VPS

The first part is to have a server ready where we can deploy Easypanel, my preferred choice is Easypanel. The recommendation for Easypanel is to have at least 2 CPUs and 2 GB of memory and you can use an Ubuntu installation. In the video, we go into detail about how you can do that on Hetzner. You can check this [Hetzner Review](https://www.wpdoze.com/hetzner-cloud-review/) for more details if you are not aware of Hetzner and what it can do.

<Button link="https://go.bitdoze.com/hetzner" text="Hetzner €⁠20 Free" />

### 2. Update the VPS server

The server needs to be up to date with latest packages, you can do that by running the bellow and reboot after.

```sh
apt update && apt -y upgrade
reboot
```

### 3. Add Server Swap

Some of the VPS providers will add swap but not Hezner, to do that you can follow the below commands, and adjust the size of the swap in function of the server memory.

```sh
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

### 4. Install Easypanel.io

To do this you just need to run a simple command and Easypanel will be installed:

```sh
curl -sSL https://get.easypanel.io | sh
```

Bellow you have the output for this:

```sh

================================================================================

To run Docker as a non-privileged user, consider setting up the
Docker daemon in rootless mode for your user:

    dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install

Visit https://docs.docker.com/go/rootless/ to learn about rootless mode.


To run the Docker daemon as a fully privileged service, but granting non-root
users access, refer to https://docs.docker.com/go/daemon-access/

WARNING: Access to the remote API on a privileged Docker daemon is equivalent
         to root access on the host. Refer to the 'Docker daemon attack surface'
         documentation for details: https://docs.docker.com/go/attack-surface/

### 5. Configure Easypanel.io

Next, we are going to start making the configs for Easeypanel to have it fully functional

#### 5.1 Point Your Domain or Subdomain to Easypanel IP

To access easypanel secure with an SSL certificate and with our own domain you will need to go into the DNS administration for your domain and create a A record that will point to the server IP, I am doing this in the video with CloudFlare and a subdomain.

#### 5.2 Add the domain in Easeypanel

After the A record is there you will need to access Easeypanel, first, you will be prompted to create a user and after you go to in Settings - General and add your domain or subdomain.

<Picture
  src={img1}
  alt="EasyPanel Admin Domain"
/>

#### 5.3 Configure the 2FA

To secure access you should activate the 2FA for your account with Google Authenticator app. You Just go to Settings - Authentication - Configure Two Factor Authentication. You will be prompted to scan the GR code in the app.

#### 5.4 Create a Github Token

If you are using EasyPanel to deploy GitHub projects that are private you will need to link it to GitHub with the token, you can visit [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and create your token. After you just add it to Settings - GitHub

### 6. Deploy First Project

Now you are ready to start deploying your first project, in the free version you can have up to 3 projects but each project can have multiple sub apps that can be added.
For a Github static website you can just add a new service APP and input GitHub details:

<Picture
  src={img2}
  alt="EasyPanel app deploy"
/>

In the Build section you have multiple options to choose from to build your app, for this I am using Nixpacks.

After you can go to domains and add your domain, it needs to be pointed to the server before.

In the same project, you can add databases or other apps through their templates.

The video has more details about EasyPanel.io interface and other things so you can check that for a more in-depth overview of easypanel.io

## Conclusions

EasyPanel is a great resource if you need a modern hosting panel that can help you host applications or databases fast you can use it for free and in case you need more like backups or advanced monitoring, user management you can go with a paid plan.
