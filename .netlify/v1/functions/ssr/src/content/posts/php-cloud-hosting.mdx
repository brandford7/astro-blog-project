### #1.Hetzner

Hetzner is a German cloud computing provider that offers high-performance and low-cost cloud servers, storage, and networking solutions. Hetzner does not offer PHP-specific hosting plans, but users can install and run any PHP application on their cloud servers, using their own or third-party server management tools.

Hetzner has ARM, Intel or AMD CPU, you can choose between dedicated or shared and different RAM sizes at very good prices. The performance is very good I am using them for more than 3 years and everything is working fine.

Hetzner in comparison with other providers like Vultr, Linode or DigitalOcean keeps low prices and good performance, a server with similar specs can be half of the price of others or even lower.

Hetzner has also backups, block storage, load balancer, floating IP addresses, DDoS protection, and more.

Givin the fact that the performance is very good and prices are good it is at the `top` of my list.

### #2.Cloudways

Cloudways is a managed cloud hosting platform that allows users to host their PHP applications on various cloud providers, such as DigitalOcean, AWS, and Google Cloud. Cloudways takes care of the server setup, configuration, optimization, and security, and provides users with a simple and intuitive dashboard to manage their PHP applications.

Cloudways is offering integrations with CloudFlare Enterprise for an extra $5 for domain which is pretty good. Cloudways servers and configs can be managed from UI and can make things very easy. The one downside is that you don't have root access to the VPS.

The price is definitely higher and it starts from $14 but it comes packed with features. Their application makes administrating a server very easy and it comes packed with a lot of functions that's why it ranks `number 2` on my list. I am suing them for clients in special that want to do things on their own and doesn't have a lot of technical knowledge.

### #3.Vultr

Vultr is a cloud hosting provider known for its high-performance SSD VPS servers, powered by the latest AMD and Intel CPUs. These servers can be deployed in under 60 seconds, making them ideal for hosting PHP applications. Vultr has 32 global data centers, which can help reduce latency and improve app performance.

It also offers robust security features, including dedicated IP addresses, DDoS protection, and a built-in firewall. Vultr's managed databases for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis simplify data management, while its scalable storage solutions can handle large amounts of data. The platform supports a wide range of operating systems and offers a user-friendly control panel for easy server management.

Vultr also provides a range of developer tools and services, including Kubernetes support for containerized PHP applications. However, managing a VPS server on Vultr requires technical expertise, so those unfamiliar with server setup and maintenance may prefer a managed hosting provider.

Vultr like Hetzner can be used with a hosting panel like **CloudPanel** or **Ploi**. Vultr starts with plans from $2.5 and it has the fastest shared cloud servers from DigitalOcean and Hetzner, made an article in here: [DigitalOcean vs Vultr vs Hetzner](https://www.wpdoze.com/digitalocean-vs-vultr-vs-hetzner/)

I have used Vultr in the past and the performance was way better than DigitalOcean one as can be seen in the article above. What made me move was Hetzner good prices and performance. Why would you not pay less for the same server with CPU, RAM and Storage and have similar performance :)

If you are in need of a datacenter closer to your visitors Vultr can help you with very good services.

**[Try Vultr and Get $100 Free to Test Them](https://go.bitdoze.com/vultr)**

### #4.Digitalocean

Digitalocean is offering services similar to Vultr and they have even more. They are some of the first that appeared and I remember that more than 5 years ago they were the ones that helped me host all the sites.

Lately I didn't have a good experience with them as I have seen some slowness in my server and my clients and decided to use Vultr then. This happened years ago and I guess it depends on the datacenter and how loaded it was.

Digitalocean comes with a lot of services and their servers are called droplets, which have a wide range of servers with high performance and so on.

Same as for the others you will need to be a little technical and use a server panel to administrate your applications. DigitalOcean is offering free credits for new comes so you can test and check for yourself the performance.

### #5.Hostinger

Hostinger's shared hosting service is an affordable and user-friendly solution for hosting PHP applications. It allows multiple websites to share the same server, making it a cost-effective choice for small to medium-sized projects.

Hostinger's shared hosting comes with a custom-made control panel, hPanel, which simplifies the setup and management of websites. It also provides an Auto Installer tool, making it easy to install PHP and other applications.

## Free PHP Hosting: Is It Possible?

If you are looking for a free way to host your PHP applications, you may be wondering if there are any free PHP hosting providers available. The answer is yes, there are some free PHP hosting providers that offer limited resources and features for PHP applications, but they come with many risks and limitations.

### Free PHP Hosting and Risks

Free PHP hosting may sound appealing, but it is not recommended for serious or professional PHP applications, as it has many drawbacks, such as:

- Low performance and reliability: Free PHP hosting providers usually have low-quality servers, overcrowded resources, and frequent downtime, which can affect the speed, uptime, and functionality of your PHP applications.
- Limited features and flexibility: Free PHP hosting providers usually have outdated PHP versions, extensions, and frameworks, as well as restricted databases, storage, bandwidth, and domains. You may not be able to customize or optimize your server environment according to your needs.
- Poor security and support: Free PHP hosting providers usually have weak security measures, such as no SSL certificates, firewalls, backups, or malware protection, which can expose your PHP applications to hackers, data loss, or corruption. You may also have no or minimal customer support, documentation, or community resources to help you with your PHP applications.
- Hidden fees and ads: Free PHP hosting providers may not be truly free, as they may charge you for extra resources, features, or services, or display unwanted ads on your PHP applications, which can affect your user experience and reputation

### Free PHP Hosting Providers

If you are looking for a free way to host your websites, but you do not want to use PHP or deal with the risks and limitations of free PHP hosting, you may want to consider some free hosting alternatives to PHP. One of the most popular and easy-to-use alternatives is static websites.

### Static Websites (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)

Static websites are websites that consist of only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, without any server-side scripting or database interaction. Static websites are simple, fast, secure, and easy to maintain, as they do not require any server configuration, installation, or processing. Static websites are also suitable for many types of websites, such as blogs, portfolios, landing pages, documentation, etc.

### Best Free Hostings for Static Websites

If you want to create and host static websites for free, you can use some of the best free hostings for static websites, such as:

**Cloudflare Pages**

Cloudflare Pages' free tier offers a comprehensive set of features for hosting websites, making it an attractive option for developers and teams. With the ability to deploy up to 500 times per month, it caters to active development environments. Each build has a maximum duration of 20 minutes, ensuring efficient use of resources. The platform supports up to 20,000 files per site, with a maximum file size limit of 25 MiB, accommodating a wide range of web projects. Users can assign up to 100 custom domains per project, providing flexibility in branding and accessibility.

A standout feature is the unlimited collaborators option, which encourages teamwork and project sharing without additional costs. Cloudflare Pages integrates seamlessly with Git, automating deployments and providing preview links for every commit and pull request, which simplifies the review and collaboration process. Additionally, the free tier includes essential security features like SSL, CDN, and DDoS protection, highlighting Cloudflare's commitment to secure and performant web hosting. This plan is designed to meet the needs of individual developers to small teams by offering a robust platform for efficiently deploying and managing web projects.

Additionally, the free tier includes serverless functions with a limit of 125k requests per site per month, with additional usage incurring a fee. Forms can be integrated into websites by adding a simple attribute to any HTML form, although the free tier has limitations on the number of form submissions and large media storage.

**Vercel**

Vercel's free tier, known as the Hobby plan, caters to personal projects, developers, and small-scale applications with a suite of features for web hosting.The plan ensures secure connections with automatic HTTPS/SSL and offers previews for every git push, enabling users to visualize changes before they go live. Notably, the Hobby plan is free and designed for non-commercial, personal use only, with no billing cycles. However, exceeding usage limits requires waiting until 30 days have passed for feature reuse.

**GitHub Pages**

GitHub Pages Free Tier offers a static site hosting service that allows you to host websites directly from a GitHub repository. It supports HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and can optionally run these files through a build process before publishing. You can host your site on GitHub's github.io domain or your own custom domain.

There are three types of GitHub Pages sites: project, user, and organization. You can create publicly available sites, and organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud can also publish sites privately. The service is available in public repositories only with the Free tier, although Free tier users can set up an unlimited number of public and private repositories. However, private repositories can't be used with GitHub Pages in the Free tier.
