Along the time I have used ChatGPT, Google Gemini or Claude AI chat tools to chat with AI and received help in day-to-day tasks that I am doing but neither is as useful as the [Perplexity.ai](https://go.bitdoze.com/perplexity)

Perplexity made me continue the PRO subscription to them while the others were canceled. In this article we are going to go thru Perplexity and what has to offer.

Perplexity AI is revolutionizing the way we search for and discover information online. By leveraging cutting-edge artificial intelligence and large language models, Perplexity provides users with highly accurate, relevant, and up-to-date answers to their questions.

Perplexity goes beyond traditional search engines by understanding the intent behind queries and engaging in conversational interactions to clarify ambiguities. This leads to a more intuitive and efficient search experience that saves users time and effort in finding the information they need.

At its core, Perplexity uses a metric called perplexity to evaluate the performance of its language models. Perplexity measures how well a model predicts a sample of text - the lower the perplexity, the better the model.
