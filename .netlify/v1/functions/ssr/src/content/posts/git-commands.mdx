Git, a distributed version control system, has become an indispensable tool for developers and DevOps professionals worldwide. Its ability to track changes, manage code versions, and facilitate collaboration on projects makes it a cornerstone of modern software development. Whether you're working on a solo project or contributing to a large team, mastering Git commands is essential for efficient and effective version control.

In this article, we will cover 100+ essential Git commands that every developer should know. These commands range from basic operations to advanced techniques, providing a comprehensive guide to navigating and utilizing Git. Each command will be explained with examples to help you understand its usage and practical applications.

## Section 1: Basic Git Commands

### 1.1 git init

The `git init` command is used to initialize a new Git repository. This command sets up all the necessary files and directories that Git needs to track changes in your project.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
$ mkdir my_project
$ cd my_project
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/my_project/.git/
```

**Explanation:**

- `mkdir my_project`: Creates a new directory named `my_project`.
- `cd my_project`: Changes the current directory to `my_project`.
- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. After running this command, a `.git` directory is created, which contains all the metadata and object database for the repository.

### 1.2 git clone

The `git clone` command is used to create a copy of an existing repository. This is particularly useful when you want to contribute to a project or use an existing project as a starting point.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
Cloning into 'repository'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 10, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (10/10), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remote: Total 10 (delta 2), reused 10 (delta 2), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

**Explanation:**

- `git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git`: Clones the repository located at the specified URL into a new directory named `repository`. The command downloads all the files, branches, and commits from the remote repository.

### 1.3 git status

The `git status` command shows the current state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
    newfile.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

**Explanation:**

- `git status`: Displays the status of the working directory and staging area. In this example, it shows that there is an untracked file named `newfile.txt`.

### 1.4 git add

The `git add` command adds file contents to the staging area. This command is used to prepare changes for the next commit.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
$ git add newfile.txt
```

**Explanation:**

- `git add newfile.txt`: Adds the file `newfile.txt` to the staging area. This means that the changes in `newfile.txt` will be included in the next commit.

### 1.5 git commit

The `git commit` command records changes to the repository. It takes a snapshot of the changes in the staging area and saves them in the repository.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add newfile.txt"
[main 1a2b3c4] Add newfile.txt
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 newfile.txt
```

**Explanation:**

- `git commit -m "Add newfile.txt"`: Creates a new commit with the message "Add newfile.txt". The commit includes the changes that were staged with `git add`.

### 1.6 git config

The `git config` command is used to configure Git settings. It can set user information, such as name and email, and other preferences.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com"
```

**Explanation:**

- `git config --global user.name "John Doe"`: Sets the global Git user name to "John Doe".
- `git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com"`: Sets the global Git user email to "johndoe@example.com".

By mastering these basic Git commands, you can start managing your projects more effectively. These commands form the foundation of Git usage, enabling you to initialize repositories, track changes, and commit updates. In the next section, we will explore branching and merging, which are crucial for managing different versions of your code.

## Section 2: Branching and Merging

Branching and merging are fundamental concepts in Git that allow developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with the main codebase. This section will cover essential commands for managing branches and merging changes.

### 2.1 git branch

The `git branch` command is used to list, create, or delete branches. Branches are pointers to specific commits, allowing you to isolate your work.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# List all branches
$ git branch
* main
  feature-branch

# Create a new branch
$ git branch new-feature

# Delete a branch
$ git branch -d feature-branch
Deleted branch feature-branch (was 1a2b3c4).
```

**Explanation:**

- `git branch`: Lists all the branches in the repository. The `*` indicates the current branch.
- `git branch new-feature`: Creates a new branch named `new-feature`.
- `git branch -d feature-branch`: Deletes the branch named `feature-branch`.

### 2.2 git checkout

The `git checkout` command is used to switch branches or restore working tree files. This command changes the current branch to the specified branch.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Switch to an existing branch
$ git checkout new-feature
Switched to branch 'new-feature'

# Create and switch to a new branch
$ git checkout -b another-feature
Switched to a new branch 'another-feature'
```

**Explanation:**

- `git checkout new-feature`: Switches the current branch to `new-feature`.
- `git checkout -b another-feature`: Creates a new branch named `another-feature` and switches to it.

### 2.3 git merge

The `git merge` command is used to merge changes from one branch into another. This is typically done to integrate changes from a feature branch into the main branch.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Switch to the main branch
$ git checkout main
Switched to branch 'main'

# Merge changes from 'new-feature' into 'main'
$ git merge new-feature
Updating 1a2b3c4..5d6e7f8
Fast-forward
 newfile.txt | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 newfile.txt
```

**Explanation:**

- `git checkout main`: Switches to the `main` branch.
- `git merge new-feature`: Merges the changes from the `new-feature` branch into the `main` branch. The output shows the details of the merge, including the commit range and the files affected.

### 2.4 git rebase

The `git rebase` command is used to reapply commits on top of another base tip. This command is useful for maintaining a linear project history.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Switch to the feature branch
$ git checkout feature-branch
Switched to branch 'feature-branch'

# Rebase onto the main branch
$ git rebase main
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: Add new feature
```

**Explanation:**

- `git checkout feature-branch`: Switches to the `feature-branch`.
- `git rebase main`: Reapplies the commits from `feature-branch` on top of the `main` branch. This process rewinds the commits in `feature-branch`, applies the changes from `main`, and then replays the commits from `feature-branch`.

### 2.5 git branch -d

The `git branch -d` command is used to delete a branch. This command ensures that the branch being deleted has been fully merged before deletion.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
# Delete a fully merged branch
$ git branch -d feature-branch
Deleted branch feature-branch (was 1a2b3c4).

# Force delete an unmerged branch
$ git branch -D unmerged-branch
Deleted branch unmerged-branch (was 5d6e7f8).
```

**Explanation:**

- `git branch -d feature-branch`: Deletes the `feature-branch` if it has been fully merged.
- `git branch -D unmerged-branch`: Force deletes the `unmerged-branch` even if it hasn't been merged.

By understanding and utilizing these branching and merging commands, you can effectively manage different versions of your code and collaborate with other developers. These commands provide the flexibility to work on multiple features simultaneously and integrate changes seamlessly.
