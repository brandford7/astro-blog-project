[FlowiseAI](https://flowiseai.com/) is an open-source platform that allows you to build and deploy custom AI workflows using a drag-and-drop interface. It provides a user-friendly way to integrate various AI models, APIs, and data sources into your applications without writing complex code. FlowiseAI is built on top of Node.js and React, making it easy to extend and customize.

In this tutorial, we are going to see how easy is to host FlowiseAI on your VPS server with docker-compose and have an SSL certificate. I will include also an option to backup the database with [Docker DB Backup](https://github.com/tiredofit/docker-db-backup) to have the SQL dumps in case something goes wrong and you can't use the volumes.

We are going to use [Dockge](https://www.bitdoze.com/dockge-install/) to administrate the docker-compose file and as reverse proxy CloudFlare Tunnels. You can also use docker-compose to deploy as it will work the same on whatever reverse proxy you prefer.

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- VPS where you can host FlowiseAI, you can use one from [Hetzner](https://go.bitdoze.com/hetzner) or use a [Mini PC as Home Server](https://www.bitdoze.com/best-mini-pc-home-server/)
- Docker and Dockge installed on your server, you can check the [Dockge - Portainer Alternative for Docker Management](https://www.bitdoze.com/dockge-install/) for the full tutorial.
- CloudFlare Tunnels are configured for your VPS server, the details are in the article here I deployed [Dockge](https://www.bitdoze.com/dockge-install/)
- OR reverse proxy with CloudPanel you can check: [Setup CloudPanel As Reverse Proxy with Docker and Dockge](https://www.bitdoze.com/cloudpanel-setup-dockge/)

> You can use also Traefik as a reverse proxy for your apps. I have created a full tutorial with Dockge install also to manage your containers on: [How to Use Traefik as A Reverse Proxy in Docker](https://www.bitdoze.com/traefik-proxy-docker/)

Having all of this you will be ready to move to next step and add the containers in Dockge.

### 2. Create Docker Compose File

The first step is to create a Docker Compose file that defines the services required to run FlowiseAI. Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  flowise-db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    hostname: flowise-db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: ${POSTGRES_DB}
      POSTGRES_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    volumes:
      - ./flowise-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${POSTGRES_USER} -d ${POSTGRES_DB}"]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  flowise:
    image: flowiseai/flowise:latest
    container_name: flowiseai
    hostname: flowise
    healthcheck:
      test: wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider http://localhost:${PORT}
    ports:
      - 5023:${PORT}
    volumes:
      - ./flowiseai:/root/.flowise
    environment:
      DEBUG: false
      PORT: ${PORT}
      FLOWISE_USERNAME: ${FLOWISE_USERNAME}
      FLOWISE_PASSWORD: ${FLOWISE_PASSWORD}
      APIKEY_PATH: /root/.flowise
      SECRETKEY_PATH: /root/.flowise
      LOG_LEVEL: info
      LOG_PATH: /root/.flowise/logs
      DATABASE_TYPE: postgres
      DATABASE_PORT: 5432
      DATABASE_HOST: flowise-db
      DATABASE_NAME: ${POSTGRES_DB}
      DATABASE_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
      DATABASE_PASSWORD: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    restart: on-failure:5
    depends_on:
      flowise-db:
        condition: service_healthy
    entrypoint: /bin/sh -c "sleep 3; flowise start"
```

This Compose file defines two services:

1. `flowise-db`: A PostgreSQL database service used by FlowiseAI to store data.
2. `flowise`: The FlowiseAI service itself, which depends on the `flowise-db` service.

The `flowise` service uses the official `flowiseai/flowise:latest` Docker image and exposes port 3000 (configurable via the `PORT` environment variable). It also mounts a volume at `/root/.flowise` to persist data across container restarts.

The Compose file also includes a healthcheck for the `flowise` service, which checks if the FlowiseAI application is running and accessible on `http://localhost:3000`.

If you want to include a backup solution for the PostgreSQL database, you can add a third service to the Compose file:

```yaml
flowise-db-backup:
  container_name: flowise-db-backup
  image: tiredofit/db-backup
  volumes:
    - ./backups:/backup
  environment:
    DB_TYPE: postgres
    DB_HOST: flowise-db
    DB_NAME: ${POSTGRES_DB}
    DB_USER: ${POSTGRES_USER}
    DB_PASS: ${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}
    DB_BACKUP_INTERVAL: 720
    DB_CLEANUP_TIME: 72000
    CHECKSUM: SHA1
    COMPRESSION: GZ
    CONTAINER_ENABLE_MONITORING: false
  depends_on:
    flowise-db:
      condition: service_healthy
  restart: unless-stopped
```

This service uses the `tiredofit/db-backup` image to create regular backups of the PostgreSQL database. The backups are stored in the `./backups` directory on the host machine.

### 3. Create .env file with credentials

Next, create a `.env` file in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file and add the required environment variables:

```sh
PORT=3000
POSTGRES_USER='user'
POSTGRES_PASSWORD='pass'
POSTGRES_DB='flowise'
FLOWISE_USERNAME=bitdoze
FLOWISE_PASSWORD=bitdoze
```

Replace the values with your desired credentials and database name.

### 4. Deploy FlowiseAI

With the Docker Compose file and the `.env` file in place, you can now deploy FlowiseAI using Docker Compose:

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start the services defined in the Compose file in detached mode (running in the background).

To check if the containers are running, use the following command:

```sh
docker ps
```

You should see the `flowise` and `flowise-db` containers listed as running.

### 5. Configure the CloudFlare Tunnels for SSL and Domain access

To access FlowiseAI securely over the internet, you can set up CloudFlare Tunnels. CloudFlare Tunnels provide a secure way to expose your FlowiseAI instance to the internet without exposing your server's IP address.

Go in **Access - Tunnels** and choose the tunnel you created and add a hostname that will link a domain or subdomain and the service and port.

### 6. Create your first FlowiseAI flow

Once your FlowiseAI instance is up and running, you can access the web interface by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` (or the domain you configured with CloudFlare Tunnels).

From the FlowiseAI interface, you can start creating your first AI workflow by dragging and dropping nodes, connecting them, and configuring their settings.

<Picture src={imag2} alt="FlowiseAI add flow" />

You have also a marketplace with flows that can be used.

### 7. Use the FlowiseAI Chatflow Externally

After you finish designing your flow, you can go and use it externally with few options like Embed, Python, JavaScript, CURL or just share it.

## Conclusions

By following this guide, you've learned how to deploy FlowiseAI to Docker using Docker Compose. You've created a Docker Compose file that defines the required services, set up environment variables, and started the FlowiseAI instance. Additionally, you've learned how to configure CloudFlare Tunnels to access your FlowiseAI instance securely over the internet.

With FlowiseAI running in Docker, you can easily manage and scale your AI workflows, while taking advantage of Docker's portability and isolation features. The Docker Compose setup also makes it easy to include additional services, such as a database backup solution, in your deployment.
